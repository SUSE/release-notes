* `yomi` is not supported anymore

[#bsc-1242130]
===== realtime sysfs entry is removed
realtime sysfs entry (/sys/kernel/realtime) is supposed to accelerate boot times if many udev rules require checking for PREEMPT_RT. However, it is not merged upstream, and we do not know if any customer relies on it, so we removed it in {productname} (RT) {this-version}.

Undoubtedly, the customer can still use the command 'uname -a' or 'uname -v' to verify if it is running RT kernel or not.
