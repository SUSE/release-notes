== {productname} Version {this-version}

These release notes apply to {productname} {this-version}.

=== Changes affecting all architectures

// jsc-SMO-573

[#bsc-1252729]
==== Cockpit disabled by default

In {productname} {this-version} we have added a systemd preset that enabled Cockpit on all installations (both new and migrations).

As this is potentially an unwanted behavior, we have reversed this change, which means that Cockpit will be disabled on all installations after the update.
To continue using Cockpit, enable the service after installing the update.

[#bsc-1242130]
===== realtime sysfs entry is removed
realtime sysfs entry (/sys/kernel/realtime) is supposed to accelerate boot times if many udev rules require checking for PREEMPT_RT. However, it is not merged upstream, and we do not know if any customer relies on it, so we removed it in {productname} (RT) {this-version}.

Undoubtedly, the customer can still use the command 'uname -a' or 'uname -v' to verify if it is running RT kernel or not.

[#deprecated]
==== Deprecated features and packages

The following features and packages are deprecated and will be removed in a future version of {productname}.
