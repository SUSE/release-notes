=== Additional container images
* SUSE Toolbox container for debugging, based on current {slea} 15 SP, provided via registry.suse.com
* PCP container image (unmodified)

=== High-level requirements
Use of {productname} without a container runtime is only supported when {productname} is used as a KVM host and workloads are installed into KVM virtual machines.
Running workloads directly on the OS is not supported, with the exception of system management software.

=== Installation modes

{productname} {this-version} only supports deployment via images.
An installer based installation method is not offered.

Customization of the installation process with the provided images can be done with Ignition and Combustion (pre-configured images and self-installing images).

We will offer select images with support for cloud-init with a later milestone.

=== Supported architectures

* Intel/{amd} 64bit (`x86_64`)
* {arm} 64bit (`aarch64`)
* {ibmz} (`s390x`)

// minimum hardware requirements
include::../shared.adoc[tags=jscped-12860,leveloffset=+3]

=== Upgrade path

An online migration of existing {productname} 5.5 installations to {productname} {this-version} is possible and is fully supported.
Upgrading from {productname} 5.5 is only possible via the `transactional-update` tool.
For the upgrade procedure, refer to {doc-url}/html/Micro-upgrade/index.html

=== Change in installation methods

With previous releases we supported manual installation via a {yast} based image.
With {productnameshort} we have dropped support for this installation method and only focus on RAW image based deployments.
The SelfInstall image variant has been extended to allow setting of various parameters to direct it and also enable an unattended installation using the SelfInstall image.

=== Installing SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro
==== Unattended installation with Yomi (technology preview)

To learn how to install a system with Yomi, see the {suma} documentation, section Install using Yomi.
Installation with Yomi is a technology preview.

==== Deploying pre-built images

{productnameshort} is provided as raw images which can be deployed directly to a storage device, for example, a memory card, a USB stick, or a hard drive.
{productnameshort} is also provided as images for specific hardware device with a customized software selection.

For a procedure of deploying an image refer to {doc-url}/html/Micro-deployment-raw-images/index.html

== Changes affecting all architectures

Information in this section applies to all architectures supported by {productnameshort} {this-version}.

// SHA1 disabled
include::../shared.adoc[tags=jscped-12210,leveloffset=+2]


=== Full-disk encryption

{productnameshort} is focused on distributed infrastructures/Edge deployments, which means systems running {productnameshort} are not necessarily within DCs or secure locations.
We therefore have improved our security story and added support for full disk encryption (FDE) to SLE
Micro.

=== Confidential compute

We are offering capabilities for confidential compute on {productnameshort} via the included virtualization stack.

=== 1:1 web-based system management

Since {productname} is positioned to be used within decentralized infrastructures including Edge use cases and Industrial Edge, a system management based on current {yast2} is not within scope.
Specifically, for Industrial Edge, a basic web-based system management was required. We have chosen the cockpit project as a base for that.
Therefore, the cockpit packages are added to the common code base and adjusted for the Immutable OS setup of  {productname}.

=== Real-time kernel

For the Intel/AMD 64bit architecture (x86_64) the real-time (rt) kernel is provided in addition to the default kernel.
Support for RT includes support for Kernel Live Patching on the RT kernel.
Note: When using the RT kernel, KVM is not supported, and workloads need to be run within containers
Containers need special treatment with RT.

=== Security/security framework

With {sle} we fully support {apparmor} and in addition provide the framework for {selinux} – without providing and supporting a policy for {selinux}.
On {productname} we do not support {apparmor}.
{productname} only supports {selinux} and in addition we ship a supported policy.
On top of that, we will look into providing dedicated {selinux} policies for the containers we already provide or support on top of {productname} (PCP and Nvidia).
{productname} {this-version} will have {selinux} in enforced mode as a default.

=== {podman} upgrade from 4.3.X. to 4.7.1

{podman} 4.7 is a major release with tons of new features and extensive bug fixes compared to {Podman} 4.3. Individual changes are to be found upstream https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md

{podman} 4.x brings a new container network stack based on Netavark, the new container network stack and Aardvark DNS server in addition to the existing container network interface (CNI) stack used by {podman} 3.x.
The new stack brings 3 important improvements:

* Better support for containers in multiple networks
* Better IPv6 support
* Better performance

To ensure that nothing breaks with this major change, the old CNI stack will remain the default on existing installations. Bear in mind that Netavark will be released as part of a maintenance update.

[WARNING]
====
Before testing {podman} 4 and the new network stack, you will have to destroy all your current containers, images, and networks.
You must export/save any import containers or images on a private registry, or make sure that your Dockerfiles are available for rebuilding and scripts/playbooks/states to reapply any settings, regenerate secrets, etc.

If you have run {podman} 3.x before upgrading to {podman} 4, {podman} will continue to use CNI plugins as it had before.
To begin using {podman} 4 with Netavark, you need to run the command podman system reset.
The command will destroy all images, networks and all containers.
====

For a complete overview of the changes, please check out the upstream 4.0.0 but also 4.1.1, 4.2.0 and 4.3.0 to be informed about all the new features and changes.

=== Legacy BIOS boot support is deprecated

With {productname} {this-version} legacy BIOS boot support on Intel/AMD 64bit systems (x86_64) is deprecated and will be removed with a later release.

=== {cockpit} web-based node management system

For web-based management of a single node, {cockpit} is included. For details, refer to https://documentation.suse.com/en-us/sle-micro/6.0/html/Micro-6.0-cockpit/.

There have been new {cockpit} modules added to the product. Due to the amount of dependencies, not all of the {cockpit} modules are part of the raw images and some have to be installed additionally.

When enabling a firewall via the {cockpit} user interface, be aware that your connection to the host may be interrupted unless the {cockpit} port is configured to be open in advance.

The {selinux} module for {cockpit} provides basic functionality for users to troubleshoot their configuration.
With this release the functionality has been extended with the introduction of the `setroubleshoot-server` package.

=== Managing {productname} with {suma}

SUSE Manager can be used to manage {productname} hosts. There are certain limitations:

* {productname} host cannot be monitored with SUSE Manager
* {suma} does not provide integrated container management yet.
As a workaround, you can use Salt via cmd.run podman.
* {suma} can manage the {productname} hosts only with the Salt stack; the traditional stack is not supported
* Ansible control node cannot be installed on {productname}

We intend to resolve these issues in the future maintenance updates of {productname} on {suma}.

=== Public Cloud Images

The Public Cloud instance initialization code has been changed from using Ignition and Afterburn to cloud-init in AWS EC2, cloud-init and the Azure agent in Azure, and the Google guest environment for GCE. This means configuration of instances through user data now behaves the same as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, any version, instances. This also addresses the issue in Azure with the state detection of the VM. The web console will now properly show a VM in "Running" state instead of appearing to be stuck in "Provisioning". This also allows user configuration through the web console in Azure and user configuration using the customary ways in AWS EC2 and GCE.

[#jsc-SMO-379]
=== Default container registries

The container registry entries for Docker Hub and openSUSE Registry, which were previously included by default, have now been removed.
If you want to pull container images from either of them, add them to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file.

[#jsc-PED-7247]
==== IMA EVM signing plugin

A RPM plugin for IMA (Integrity Measurement Architecture)/EVM (Linux Extended Verification Module) signing has been added.
The plugin is installed as part of the following package:

* `rpm-imaevmsign`

=== Toolbox container

When you run the toolbox script to pull and start the toolbox container, a previous version of the container image needs to be pulled.
To do that, edit the `~/.toolboxrc` file, for example like this:

[source,console]
----
cat << EOF > ~/.toolboxrc
IMAGE=suse/sle-micro/5.5/toolbox:latest
EOF
----

NOTE: This will be fixed in a future release.

This does not influence toolbox funcionality and you can use the toolbox container as needed.

[#bsc-1229336]
=== Default console settings optimized for {rpi}

The {productnameshort} {this-version} {aarch64} images use default kernel
command line settings tuned for easy evaluation on {rpireg} devices.

For usage with {arm} BSA-compliant servers you will have to edit the
command line in the GRUB menu:

* Drop `console=ttyS0,115200`. Optionally try `console=ttyAMA0,115200` or similar for serial output, including IPMI Serial-over-LAN via a BMC.
* Drop `console=tty0` if you don't need the console output on a graphical display.

This behavior will change with {productnameshort} {next-version}.
