== {productname} Version {this-version}

These release notes apply to {productname} {this-version}.

=== Changes affecting all architectures

[#jsc-PED-13396-1]
==== `saptune` base tuning

The `saptune` package will enable base tuning upon installation.
Base tuning only will be enabled if `saptune` was not configured before (no SAP Notes or Solutions selected).


[#jsc-DOCTEAM-1853]
==== `hostname` command behavior difference

On {slesa} 15 SP6, the `hostname` command returns the short hostname by default.
However, on {productname} {this-version}, the `hostname` command returns the fully qualified domain name by default.

This difference in default behavior might cause issues in installation scripts that rely on a specific output format of the hostname command without using options like `-s` or `-A`.
Scripts should be reviewed to explicitly request the desired hostname format using hostname `-s` for the short hostname or hostname `-A` for the fully qualified domain name to ensure consistent behavior across different {productname} versions.


=== Changes affecting all architectures (Beta 4)

This section contains information specific to Beta4.
We are working on fixing the problems mentioned here.
The content of this section will be removed for the final released product.


[#jsc-DOCTEAM-1852]
==== `/etc/init.d` not found

When installing {hana} or {nw}, the following error is shown:

[source]
Installation of SAP HANA Database System failed.
  Installation of SAP HANA Database failed
    Installation failed
      error installing
        Cannot create system
          Cannot copy file /hana/shared/PBO/global/hdb/saphostagent_setup/sapinit' => '/etc/init.d/sapinit'
            Destination directory /etc/init.d not found: No such file or directory


This is due to the removal of SysV init script support.
As a workaround, create the `/etc/init.d` directory.

[#jsc-DOCTEAM-1851]
==== SELinux enforcing mode causes error during {hana} installation

When installing {hana}, the following error is shown:

[source]
 Installing SAP Host Agent version 7.22.62...
  Starting SAP HANA Database system...
Installation of SAP HANA Database System failed.
  Installation of SAP HANA Database failed
    Installation failed
      error installing
        Cannot create Instance
          Cannot start system
            Start instance 00 on host 'susetest' (worker) failed.
              Cannot establish http connection to unix domain socket '/tmp/.sapstream50013' (No such file or directory)
            Check the log file for SAP HANA Database error messages

As a workaround, run these commands:

1. Run these commands after operating system installation:
[source,bash]
    semanage boolean -m --on selinuxuser_execmod
    semanage boolean -m --on unconfined_service_transition_to_unconfined_user
    semanage permissive -a snapper_grub_plugin_t
    restorecon -R /
2. Install SAP Workload or SAP HANA
3. Run `restorecon -R /`.

If you are on a transactional system, run this instead of `restorecon -R /`: `touch /etc/selinux/.autorelabel`.


[#jsc-DOCTEAM-1850]
==== Missing `/etc/services` file causes NetWeaver installation failure

Installing NetWeaver can result in the following error:

[source]
>ERROR     2025-01-22 16:07:29.467 (root/sapinst) (startInstallation) [CSiStepExecute.cpp:1104] id=controller.stepExecuted errno=FCO-00011 >CSiStepExecute::execute()
>The step createPorts with step key >|NW_ABAP_ASCS|ind|ind|ind|ind|0|0|NW_System|ind|ind|ind|ind|system|0|NW_SAPHostAgent|ind|ind|ind|ind|hostagent|0|createPorts was executed with status ERROR (Last error reported by the step: Node /etc/services does not exist).

Accessing `/etc/services` is considered a software bug and should be fixed in the affected software.
As a temporary workaround, an empty `/etc/services` file will be added later.
If you need to work around this problem earlier, create the file manually: `touch /etc/services`.

=== Changes affecting all architectures (Beta2)

This section contains information specific to Beta2.
We are working on fixing the problems mentioned here.

[#bsc-1238590]
==== Not possible to SSH after installation

After installation of {productname}, SSH is not enabled by default.

To enable SSH during installation, provide a SSH public key for the `root` user.

[NOTE]
This behavior differs between {sles} and {slessap}.
In {sles}, SSH is enabled by default during installation even if public key for `root` is not provided.
