   <para>
    SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension is a suite of
    clustering technologies that enable enterprises to implement highly
    available Linux clusters and eliminate single points of failure. This
    document gives an overview of features of SUSE Linux Enterprise High
    Availability Extension and their limitations. Some sections do not apply
    to a particular architecture or product, this is explicitly marked.

  <title>SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension</title>
  <para>
   SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension is an affordable,
   integrated suite of robust open source clustering technologies that
   enable enterprises to implement highly available Linux clusters and
   eliminate single points of failure.
  </para>
  <para>
   Used with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, it helps firms maintain business
   continuity, protect data integrity, and reduce unplanned downtime for
   their mission-critical Linux workloads.
  </para>
  <para>
   SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension provides all of the
   essential monitoring, messaging, and cluster resource management
   functionality of proprietary third-party solutions, but at a more
   affordable price, making it accessible to a wider range of enterprises.
  </para>
  <para>
   It is optimized to work with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, and its tight
   integration ensures customers have the most robust, secure, and up to
   date high availability solution. Based on an innovative, highly flexible
   policy engine, it supports a wide range of clustering scenarios.
  </para>
  <para>
   With static or stateless content, the High Availability cluster can be
   used without a cluster file system. This includes web-services with
   static content as well as printing systems or communication systems like
   proxies that do not need to recover data.
  </para>
  <para>
   Finally, its open source license minimizes the risk of vendor lock-in,
   and it's adherence to open standards encourages interoperability with
   industry standard tools and technologies.

    <title>Relax-and-Recover: Upgrade to Latest Stable Upstream Version</title>
    <para>
     The current version of Relax-and-Recover (abbreviated as 'rear',
     formerly 'ReaR') comes with many new features and fundamental changes.
     In particular the file system creation is totally different (via the so
     called "layout workflow" instead of the old "dr workflow" that has been
     removed in version 1.14).
    </para>
    <para>
     Warning: Users who already use it and want to upgrade (in particular
     when upgrading from SUSE Linux Enterprise 11), must carefully
     re-validate whether their particular disaster recovery procedure still
     works.
    </para>
    <para>
     A new and different RPM package name is used that contains the version
     (e.g. "rear116"). It conflicts with all other rear packages to avoid
     that an installed version could get accidentally replaced with another
     version. This means "just a normal package installation" that would do
     a version change of an already installed Relax-and Recover software is
     intentionally prohibited.
    </para>
    <para>
     Furthermore this version upgrade supersedes the formerly provided
     package rear-SUSE.

    <title>crmsh: Configure all nodes in the cluster simultaneously using cluster scripts</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Ensuring that all nodes in the cluster have the correct
     packages and file system configuration can be difficult. Sometimes, a
     configuration wizard could be improved if it could make system-level
     changes or inspect the state of all cluster nodes before applying a new
     CIB configuration.</emphasis>

     The crm shell now includes cluster scripts, which are able to validate
     and modify the configuration of cluster nodes.

     <emphasis>When scripting cluster configuration changes, the scripts are

     shadow CIB to collect the changes makes this easier, but has previously
     required naming the shadow CIB.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     crmsh now allows the creation of shadow CIBs without explicitly
     specifying a name. The name will be determined automatically and will
     not clash with any other previously created shadow CIBs.

    <title>Enable colocating resources without further dependency between them</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Sometimes, it is desired that two resources should run on the
     same node. However, there should be no further dependency implied
     between the two resources, so that if one fails, the other one can keep
     running.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     This can be accomplished using a third, dummy resource which both
     resources depend on in turn. To make it easier to create a
     configuration like this, the command "assist weak-bond" has been added
     to crmsh.

    <title>hawk: Wizards Can Use Multiple Instances of a Template Within a Workflow</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Simplify wizards with multiple identical config

    </para>
    <para>
     In a wizard workflow, multiple steps to reference the same wizard
     template with different sets of parameters are supported.
    </para>
    <para>
     This is done by adding a type attribute to the template instance in the
     workflow, which can be separate from the name identifying the step in
     the workflow. Each step in the workflow can also override any attribute
     of the wizard template, including the description.

     This change is backwards compatible.
