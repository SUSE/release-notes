 <section id="intro">
  <title>&sleha;</title>
  <para> &sleha; is an affordable, integrated suite of robust open source clustering
   technologies that enable enterprises to implement highly available Linux clusters and eliminate
   single points of failure. </para>
  <para> Used with &sles;, it helps firms maintain business continuity, protect data integrity,
   and reduce unplanned downtime for their mission-critical Linux workloads. </para>
  <para> &sleha; provides all of the essential monitoring, messaging, and cluster resource
   management functionality of proprietary third-party solutions, but at a more affordable price,
   making it accessible to a wider range of enterprises. </para>
  <para> It is optimized to work with &sles;, and its tight integration ensures customers have
   the most robust, secure, and up to date high availability solution. Based on an innovative,
   highly flexible policy engine, it supports a wide range of clustering scenarios. </para>
  <para> With static or stateless content, the High Availability cluster can be used without a
   cluster file system. This includes web-services with static content as well as printing systems
   or communication systems like proxies that do not need to recover data. </para>
  <para> Finally, its open source license minimizes the risk of vendor lock-in, and it's adherence
   to open standards encourages interoperability with industry standard tools and technologies. </para>
