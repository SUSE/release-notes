  &product; is an affordable, integrated suite of robust open source
  clustering technologies that enable enterprises to implement highly
  available Linux clusters and eliminate single points of failure.
  Used in combination with &sles;, it helps organizations maintain business
  continuity, protect data integrity, and reduce unplanned downtime for their
  mission-critical Linux workloads.
 </para>

  &product; provides all essential monitoring, messaging, and cluster
  resource management functionality of proprietary third-party solutions, but
  at a more affordable price, making it accessible to a wider range of
  enterprises.
 </para>
 <para>
