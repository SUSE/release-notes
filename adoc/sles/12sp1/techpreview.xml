 <para>
  Technology previews are packages, stacks, or features delivered by
  SUSE. These features are not supported. They may be functionally
  incomplete, unstable or in other ways not suitable for production use.
  They are mainly included for customer convenience and give customers a
  chance to test new technologies within an enterprise
  environment.
 </para>

 <para>
  Whether a technical preview will be moved to a fully supported package
  later, depends on customer and market feedback. A technical preview
  does not automatically result in support at a later point in time.
  Technical previews could be dropped at any time and SUSE is not
  committed to provide a technical preview later in the product
  cycle.
 </para>

 <para>
  Please, give your SUSE representative feedback, including your
  experience and use case.

    If your specific machine is not listed, please call SUSE support to
    confirm whether or not your machine has been successfully
    tested. Also, regularly check our maintenance update information,
    which will explicitly mention the general availability of this
    feature.

     Restriction on using IBM eHCA InfiniBand adapters in conjunction with
     hot-add memory on IBM Power:
   </para>
   <para>
     The current eHCA Device Driver will prevent dynamic memory operations on
     a partition as long as the driver is loaded. If the driver is unloaded
     prior to the operation and then loaded again afterwards, adapter
     initialization may fail. A Partition Shutdown / Activate sequence on the
     HMC may be needed to recover from this situation.

      biosdevname in its simplest form takes a kernel name as
      an argument and returns the BIOS-given name it "should"
      be. This is necessary on systems where the BIOS name for
      a given device (e.g., the label on the chassis is "Gb1")
      doesn't map directly and obviously to the kernel name
      (e.g., eth0).

  <!--
  <section>
   <title>Read-Only Root File System</title>
   <para>It is possible to run &sles; 12 on a shared read-only root
   file system.  A read-only root setup consists of the read-only root
   file system, a scratch and a state file system.  The
   <filename>/etc/rwtab</filename> file defines which files and
   directories on the read-only root file system are replaced by which
   files on the state and scratch file systems for each system
   instance.</para>

   <para>The <filename>readonlyroot</filename> kernel command line
   option enables read-only root mode; the <filename>state=</filename>
   and <filename>scratch=</filename> kernel command line options
   determine the devices on which the state and scratch file systems are
   located.</para>

   <para>In order to set up a system with a read-only root file system,
   set up a scratch file system, set up a file system to use for storing
   persistent per-instance state, adjust
   <filename>/etc/rwtab</filename> as needed, add the appropriate kernel
   command line options to your boot loader configuration, replace
   <filename>/etc/mtab</filename> with a symlink to
   <filename>/proc/mounts</filename> as described below, and (re)boot
   the system.</para>
<remark>emap: Confusing paragraph. Should be broken into steps like
below (where it's not really necessary.</remark>
<remark>ke: I'd say, as an overview it is probably ok-\-at least, for the
moment.</remark>

   <para>To replace <filename>/etc/mtab</filename> with the appropriate
   symlinks, call:</para>
   <screen>ln -sf /proc/mounts /etc/mtab</screen>

   <para>See the rwtab(5) manual page for further details and <ulink
   url="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp4.52.html"/> for
   limitations on System z.</para>
