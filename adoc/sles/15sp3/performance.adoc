==== `perf stat` allows configuring whether to run used events in kernel space or user space

The `perf` tool offers a rich set of commands to collect and analyze performance and trace data.

`perf record` supports `--all-kernel`/`--all-user` to configure all used events to run in kernel space or run in user space.
However, in the version of `perf` shipped with {product} 15{nbsp}SP2, `perf stat` does not support these options.

In {sles} {this-version}, we have updated `perf stat` to support the `--all-kernel` and `--all-user` options to keep the same semantics available in both commands.
