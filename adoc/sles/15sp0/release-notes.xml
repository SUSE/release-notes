   Release notes usually only list changes that happened between two subsequent
   releases. Certain important entries from the release notes documents of
   previous product versions are repeated. To make these entries easier to
   identify, they contain a note to that effect.

   However, repeated entries are provided as a courtesy only. Therefore, if you
   are skipping one or more service packs, check the release notes of the
   skipped service packs as well. If you are only reading the release notes of
   the current release, you could miss important changes.

      To install without network connection, all necessary
      packages are available on the Packages medium. This medium consists of
      directories with module repositories which need to be added manually as
      needed. RMT (Repository Mirroring Tool) and SUSE Manager provide

      : Starting with SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 GA,
      we support migrating from openSUSE Leap 15 to SUSE Linux Enterprise
      Server 15. Thus, even if you decide to start out with the free community

      As a technology preview, SLE 15 now supports AMD Secure Encrypted
      Virtualization (SEV). SEV integrates main memory encryption capabilities
      (SME) with the existing AMD-V virtualization architecture to support
      encrypted virtual machines. Encrypting virtual machines helps protect
      them from physical threats and other virtual machines or even the
      hypervisor itself. SEV represents a new approach to security that is
      particularly suited to cloud computing where virtual machines may not
      fully trust the hypervisor and administrator of their host system. As
      with SME, no application software modifications are required to support
      SEV.

     <title>Exploitation of Shared Memory Communications</title>
     <para>
      As a technology preview, the kernel of SLE 15 enables Shared Memory
      Communications over RDMA (SMC-R) enabled. SMC-R allows RDMA network
      interface controllers (RNICs) to offer RDMA over Converged Ethernet
      (RoCE).

     <emphasis>The installation can be done remotely using VNC, and there are
     two options for the client software: A native VNC viewer or a Web browser
     viewer. For the Web browser viewer we replaced a Java-applet based
     implementation with an implementation using JavaScript/WebSocket, as Java
     is no longer supported in mainstream browsers. Unfortunately, that has
     resulted in the loss of an encryption layer for the Web browser
     viewer.</emphasis>

     5901 continues to be encrypted.

    <title>Parted Supports Linux-Specific GPT GUID for Partitions</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>When Parted 3.1, the version shipped with earlier versions of
     SLE, was released, there was no Linux-specific GPT GUID. Therefore, it
     used the Microsoft Basic Data partition type for all new
     partitions.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     With SLE 15, Parted 3.2 is shipped. This version uses the new Linux GPT
     GUID by default. If an old Linux GPT partition that uses the Microsoft
     Basic Data type is found, Parted will set the flag
     <literal>msftdata</literal>
     on it.
    </para>
    <para>
     In partition editors and other GPT-enabled disk tools, such partitions may
     be mislabeled as
     <emphasis>Windows Data Partitions</emphasis>
     or similar.
     This affects the YaST Expert Partitioner, as well as
     <literal>fdisk</literal>
     ,

    <title>Handling of Extension Repositories in AutoYaST</title>
    <para>
     Starting with SLE 15, AutoYaST handles extension repositories in a more
     user-friendly way:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       AutoYaST automatically reorders extension repositories according to
       their dependent repositories during registration. That means the order
       of extensions in the AutoYaST profile is not important anymore.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       If dependent extensions are missing from the AutoYaST profile, AutoYaST
       will automatically register them. However, this only works for
       extensions that do not require a registration key. Extensions that
       require a registration key must be listed in the AutoYaST profile,
       including the registration key.
      </para>

    <title>AutoYaST Configuration Is Done After Reboot</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>A regular YaST-based installation of SLES 15 is performed in a
     single stage. However, the AutoYaST installation process is divided into
     two stages. After the installation of the basic system, the system boots
     into the second stage during which the system is configured.</emphasis>

     Make sure that the packages
     <literal>autoyast2</literal>

    <title>YaST and AutoYaST Changes Because of Switch to firewalld</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>SuSEFirewall2 has been removed from SLES 15.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     SLE 15 introduces firewalld as the new software firewall. This also incurs
     changes to installation and system management with YaST and AutoYaST.
    </para>
    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">YaST</bridgehead>
    <para>
     firewalld already provides a command-line interface
     (
     <literal>firewall-cmd</literal>
     ) and a new graphical interface
     (
     <literal>firewall-config</literal>
     ) for configuration. Therefore, the
     YaST command-line interface and the GUI for SuSEFirewall2 have largely
     been removed. However, YaST continues to provide a common interface for
     opening ports for different services.
    </para>
    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">AutoYaST</bridgehead>
    <para>
     AutoYaST profiles based on SuSEFirewall2 do not fit with the firewalld
     configuration. This meant that a new AutoYaST schema for configuring
     firewalld was needed. However, you can still use SuSEFirewall2-based
     profiles but are limited in terms of supported properties. This
     configuration will then be translated to firewalld rules. However, we
     recommend using the new schema and also checking the configuration when
     the system is installed.
    </para>

    <title>Product Registration Changes for HPC Customers</title>
    <tip role="compact">
     <para>
      This entry has appeared in a previous release notes document.
     </para>
    </tip>
    <para>
     <emphasis>For SUSE Linux Enterprise 12, there was a High Performance
     Computing subscription named "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for HPC" (SLES
     for HPC). With SLE 15, this subscription does not exist anymore and has
     been replaced. The equivalent subscription is named "SUSE Linux Enterprise
     High Performance Computing" (SLE-HPC) and requires a different license
     key. Because of this requirement, a SLES for HPC 12 system will by default
     upgrade to a regular "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server".</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     To properly upgrade a SLES for HPC system to a SLE-HPC, the system needs
     to be converted to SLE-HPC first. SUSE provides a tool to simplify this
     conversion by performing the product conversion and switch to the SLE-HPC
     subscription. However, the tool does not perform the upgrade itself.
    </para>
    <para>
     When run without extra parameters, the script assumes that the SLES for
     HPC subscription is valid and not expired. If the subscription has
     expired, you need to provide a valid registration key for SLE-HPC.
    </para>
    <para>
     The script reads the current set of registered modules and extensions and
     after the system has been converted to SLE-HPC, it tries to add them
     again.

     BIOS RAID, as provided by some chipsets or additional cards, is managed by

    <title>Manually Selecting Repositories When Upgrading from SLES 12 to SLES 15</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>When upgrading a system which is registered against SCC, the
     registration server drives the selection of modules and repositories to be
     used during upgrade. This works well in most cases. However, there are
     scenarios in which modules or extensions are not selected as desired. For
     example, this can be the case when third-party software is installed and
     needs to be upgraded.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     To allow manual selection of repositories, when booting the upgrade ISO,
     add
     <literal>media_upgrade=1</literal>
     to the kernel command line. This
     will make YaST skip the communication with SCC and you will have full
     control over the selection of repositories.
    </para>
    <para>
     After the upgrade the system needs to be registered again, to update the
     registration data in SCC and to get access to the update channels for SUSE
     Linux Enterprise 15.
    </para>
    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">Notes regarding the standard migration (via SCC)</bridgehead>
    <para>
     At the beginning of the upgrade, YaST registers the system to SLE 15. If
     the upgrade is aborted, YaST automatically rolls back the registration to
     the SLE 12 state. However, if the upgrade is aborted unexpectedly (for
     example, because of a power failure or hard reset), the registration state
     is not rolled back. In that case, you might need to run the rollback
     manually after booting the original system using the command
     <literal>SUSEConnect --rollback</literal>

    <title>Support for SAP HANA Workloads on Intel Optane DC Memory</title>
    <para>
     SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP
     Applications 15 add support for Intel Optane DC memory. This enables SAP
     workloads, such as SAP HANA to benefit from persistent memory in the
     future to shorten start times of the system and provide better overall
     system stability. Currently, configurations up to 12 TB of NVDIMMs plus 3
     TB of regular DIMMS of supported memory and 4 socket machines have been
     tested. Additional configurations will be tested over time.
    </para>
    <para>
     From a file system perspective, the XFS file system is supported for the
     NVDIMMs, with SAP HANA running in DAX mode. SUSE intends to keep the
     leading position as technology provider, working closely with SAP on
     future developments.
    </para>
    <para>
     If there are
     <literal>pmem</literal>
     namespaces, these need to be
     destroyed before the installation. To mount persistent memory directly on
     boot, we recommend adding the
     <literal>nofail</literal>
     mount option in
     <literal>/etc/fstab</literal>
     as it can take a long time for the
     <literal>/dev/pmem</literal>
     devices to become usable.
    </para>
    <para>
     For example:
    </para>
    <screen>/dev/pmem0    /mnt/pmem0    xfs    dax,nofail    0  0
/dev/pmem1    /mnt/pmem1    xfs    dax,nofail    0  0</screen>
    <para>
     Namespaces need to be created individually. That means, you need to
     execute the following command for each namespace you want to create:
    </para>
    <screen>ndctl create-namespace --mode=fsdax --map=dev</screen>

    <title>Page Cache Limit Is Now Opt-in cgroup Isolation</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>The kernel swaps out rarely accessed memory pages to use freed
     memory pages as cache to speed up file system operations, for example
     during backup operations. Certain applications use large amounts of memory
     for accelerated access to business data. Rarely accessed parts of this
     memory are subject of this swap out. Later access to swapped out memory
     regions results in poor application response times.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     In previous SUSE Linux Enterprise versions there was a tunable known as
     page cache limit to mitigate this problem. This has now been replaced with
     a more mature mainline mechanism known as opt-in memory cgroup isolation.
    </para>
    <para>
     A memory cgroup can define its so-called low limit
     (
     <literal>memory.low_limit_in_bytes</literal>
     ) which works as a protection
     against memory pressure. Work loads that need to be isolated from outside
     memory management activity should set the value to the expected Resident
     Set Size (RSS) plus some head room. If a memory pressure condition
     triggers on the system and the particular group is still under its low
     limit, its memory is protected against being reclaimed. As a result, work
     loads outside of the cgroup do not need the aforementioned capping.

    <title>Support for AMD Memory Encryption</title>
    <para>
     To provide protection against physical attacks on a system, AMD SME can
     provide full or partial memory encryption depending on the use case, on
     AMD family 17h CPU processors. Full memory encryption means all DRAM
     contents are encrypted using random keys. This provides strong protection
     against cold boot, DRAM interface snooping and similar types of attacks.
     This technology is especially prominent for systems equipped with NVDIMMs
     whose contents remain intact after powering down the system.
    </para>
    <para>
     Memory encryption support is present in SLE 15 kernels but not enabled by
     default. To enable it on compatible hardware (AMD family 17h CPU, with
     proper BIOS/UEFI support), supply the boot option

     <emphasis>Research was published that showed weakesses in the SHA-1 family
     of hashes for some applications. The use of stronger digests is advised
     for most applications.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     The default behavior for GnuPG (
     <literal>gpg2</literal>
     ) has been changed
     to use SHA-2 family digests for key certificates, default preferences
     stored in keys, and signature generation in the absense of a configuration
     file. GnuPG no longer generates a new configuration when called in an
     empty home. Existing GnuPG configurations are not altered. GnuPG continues
     to support SHA-1 digest generation and verification as mandated by OpenPGP
     standards.

    <title>firewalld Replaces SuSEfirewall2 as Default Software Firewall</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>SuSEfirewall2 was originally tailored towards running a router
     with forwarding and/or NAT rules. This use case is rarely required
     anymore. Furthermore, the static nature of SuSEfirewall2 made it difficult
     to react to today's dynamic networking events like hotplugged network
     interfaces or virtual networking.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     To allow greater flexibility in SLE 15, the default firewall has been
     switched to the firewalld upstream solution. It provides a resident daemon
     process which can dynamically adjust firewall rules on behalf of the user
     or other programs. SuSEfirewall2 is no longer available.
    </para>
    <para>
     There is no automatic migration from SuSEfirewall2 to firewalld. To
     migrate an existing SuSEfirewall2 configuration to firewalld, you can use
     the script from the package
     <literal>susefirewall2-to-firewalld</literal>
     .
     However, after running the script, you still need to manually adjust and
     verify the resulting firewalld rules.
    </para>
    <para>
     More technical information about firewalld could be found in the Security
     Guide at

    <title>SDT Markers in Select Applications and Libraries</title>

     <emphasis> SDT markers are static tracepoints included in the source code

    <title>Better AutoYaST Device Resize Handling</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis> In SLE 12 and earlier, AutoYaST only supported resizing
     partitions but not logical volumes. Moreover, specifying the new size was
     quite limited, as values like </emphasis>
     max
     <emphasis> or
     </emphasis>
     auto
     <emphasis> were not allowed. Additionally, when using a
     percentage as the value of a resizing operation, the percentage was
     assumed to refer to the previous size of the partition. This was different
     from creating a partition where percentages refer to device size.
     </emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     AutoYaST now supports resizing both partitions and logical volumes.
     Additionally, the
     <emphasis>size</emphasis>
     element will behave the same
     way, no matter whether a partition or logical volume is being created or
     resized: Percentages always refer to size of the whole device.

    <title>Alignment of Partition Size in the Storage Proposal and Expert Partitioner</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>To avoid the performance drop caused by excessive
     read-modify-write cycles, the partitions in a system must be properly
     aligned. Even beyond performance considerations, some types of partition
     tables require alignment to work. For example, DASD partition tables need
     to be aligned to tracks (usually 12 sectors).</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     In SLE 15, the expert partitioner of YaST takes alignment into
     consideration when creating and resizing partitions. It ensures alignment
     where it is required (such as DASD tracks) and encourages alignment where
     it can help performance, avoiding gaps between partitions in the process.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you specify a size in the expert partitoner, the start and end of the
     partition will be aligned to ensure optimal performance and to minimize
     gaps. This may result in a slightly smaller partition (the difference is
     usually less than 1 MiB).
    </para>
    <para>
     If you specify a custom region, the start and end will be honored as
     closely as possible, without attempting to optimize performance. However,
     mandatory alignment, such as DASD tracks, will take place. This option is
     best suited to creating very small partitions.
    </para>
    <para>
     The same considerations for optimal alignment will also be taken into
     account while resizing an existing partition and calculating the minimal
     and maximal sizes suggested by the partitioner during that process.

    <title>No Default Compose Key Combination</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis> In previous versions of SLE, the compose key combination
     allowed typing characters that were not part of the regular keyboard
     layout. For example, to produce "å", you could press and release
     Shift-Right Ctrl and then press </emphasis>
     <literal>a</literal>
     <emphasis>
     twice. </emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     Starting with SLE 15, there is no longer a predefined compose key
     combination because Shift-Right Ctrl does not work as expected anymore.

      </para>
      <screen>[...]
!! Third example: Change right Control key to Compose key.
!! To do Compose Character, press this key and afterwards two

   <title>Reduced Memory Usage When Booting FADump Capture Kernel</title>
   <tip role="compact">
    <para>
     This entry has appeared in a previous release notes document.
    </para>
   </tip>
   <para>
    One of the primary issues with Firmware Assisted Dump (FADump) on IBM POWER
    systems is that it needs a large amount of memory to be reserved. On large
    systems with terabytes of memory, this reservation can be significant.
   </para>
   <para>
    Normally, the preserved memory is filtered to extract only relevant areas
    using the
    <literal>makedumpfile</literal>
    tool. While the tool allows
    determining what needs to be part of the dump and what memory to filter
    out, the default is to capture only kernel data and exclude everything
    else.
   </para>
   <para>
    We take advantage of this default and the Linux kernel's Contiguous Memory
    Allocator (CMA) to fundamentally change the memory reservation model for
    FADump: Instead of setting aside a significant chunk of memory that cannot
    otherwise be used, the feature uses CMA instead. It reserves a significant
    chunk of memory that the kernel is prevented from using (due to
    <literal>MIGRATE_CMA</literal>
    ), but applications are free to use it. With
    this, FADump will still be able to accurately capture all of the kernel
    memory and most of the user-space memory except for the user pages that are
    part of the CMA region reserved for FADump.
   </para>
   <para>
    To disable this feature, pass the kernel parameter
    <literal>fadump=nocma</literal>
    instead of
    <literal>fadump=on</literal>
    .
    This ensures that the memory reserved for FADump is not used by
    applications. This option may be useful in scenarios where you prefer to
    also capture application data in the dump file.

    When communicating between LPARs within the same system, the interface's

   <title>Raspberry Pi Using Device Tree From Firmware</title>
   <para>
    <emphasis> The U-Boot bootloader shipped with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
    for ARM 12 SP3 for the Raspberry Pi passed its own Device Tree to Linux.
    That way, all user-configured Device Tree modifications by its firmware
    were discarded. The only way to modify the Device Tree then was to override
    it with a user-provided
    </emphasis>

   <title>Boot and Driver Enablement for Raspberry Pi</title>
   <para>
    Bootloaders and a supported microSD card image of SUSE Linux Enterprise
    Server for Arm 15 for the Raspberry Pi are available. The template of the

   <bridgehead renderas="sect5">Expansion Boards</bridgehead>
   <para>
    The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B/B+ offers a 40-pin General Purpose I/O
    connector, with multiple software-configurable functions such as UART, I²C
    and SPI. This pin mux configuration along with any external devices
    attached to the pins is defined in the Device Tree which is passed by the
    bootloader to the kernel.
   </para>
   <para>
    SUSE does not currently provide support for any particular HATs or other
    expansion boards attached to the 40-pin GPIO connector. However, insofar as
    drivers for pin functions and for attached chipsets are included in SUSE
    Linux Enterprise, they can be used. SUSE does not provide support for
    making changes to the Device Tree, but successful changes will not affect
    the support status of the operating system itself. Be aware that errors in
    the Device Tree can stop the system from booting successfully or can even
    damage the hardware.
   </para>
   <para>
    The bootloader and firmware in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 now support
    Device Tree Overlays. The new recommended way of configuring GPIO pins is
    to create a file
    <literal>extraconfig.txt</literal>
    on the FAT volume
    (
    <literal>/boot/efi/extraconfig.txt</literal>
    in the SUSE image) with a
    line
    <literal>dtoverlay=filename-without-.dtbo</literal>
    per Overlay. For
    more information about the syntax, see the documentation by the Raspberry
    Pi Foundation.
   </para>
   <para>
    As a side effect, no separate
    <literal>/boot</literal>
    partition is needed
    anymore. This allows booting Btrfs snapshots in the SUSE image.

   <para>

    <literal>/boot/efi/overlays/</literal>
    directory (

    files can be obtained from the manufacturer of the
    HAT or compiled from self-authored sources.

     PostgreSQL 10 also brings an important change to the versioning scheme
     that is used for PostgreSQL: It now follows the format
     <emphasis>major.minor</emphasis>
     . This means that minor releases of
     PostgreSQL 10 are for example 10.1, 10.2, ... and the next major release
     will be 11. Previously, both the parts of the version number were
     significant for the major version. For example, PostgreSQL 9.3 and
     PostgreSQL 9.4 were different major versions.

       For SLE 12, this means installing

       <literal>pg_upgrade</literal>
       is contained in the package

       SQL command on each

     OpenSSL libraries version 1.0.x were moved to the Legacy Module. The

    <title>Legacy Module: OpenLDAP Client Libraries Have Been Moved to the Legacy Module</title>

    <para>
     As
     <literal>389-ds</literal>
     is compatible with the OpenLDAP client

     an easier transition for customers that currently use the OpenLDAP Server.

     In the past, the

     and
     <literal>libldap_r.so</literal>
     , the latter being thread-safe and
     therefore recommended to be used. For that reason, in SLE 15, the package
     <literal>libldap</literal>
     only provides the
     <literal>libldap_r.so</literal>
     library. For backward compatibility, there
     is the additional package
     <literal>libldap-legacy</literal>
     , that provides
     a
     <literal>libldap.so</literal>
     library that redirects to the

     library.

    <para>
     The packages
     <literal>pam_ldap</literal>

     Since SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2, we removed the 32-bit
     hypervisor as a virtualization host. 32-bit virtual guests are not
     affected and are fully supported with the provided 64-bit hypervisor.

     SUSE Linux Enterprise was the first enterprise Linux distribution to
     support journaling file systems and logical volume managers back in 2000.
     Later, we introduced XFS to Linux, which today is seen as the primary work
     horse for large-scale file systems, systems with heavy load and multiple
     parallel reading and writing operations. With SUSE Linux Enterprise 12, we
     went the next step of innovation and started using the copy-on-write file
     system Btrfs as the default for the operating system, to support system
     snapshots and rollback.

     Btrfs is a
     copy-on-write file system. Instead of journaling changes before writing
     them in-place, it writes them to a new location and then links the new
     location in. Until the last write, the changes are not
     <quote>committed</quote>
     . Because of the nature of the file system, quotas
     are implemented based on subvolumes (

     Maximum file size above can be larger than the file system's actual size
     because of the use of sparse blocks. All standard file systems on SUSE
     Linux Enterprise Server have LFS, which gives a maximum file size of
     2
     <superscript>63</superscript>
      bytes in theory.

    <para>
     The numbers in the above table assume that the file systems are using a
     4 KiB block size which is the most common standard. When using different

     Some file system features are available in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15
     GA but are not supported by SUSE. By default, the file system drivers in
     SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 GA will refuse mounting file systems that
     use unsupported features (in particular, in read-write mode). To enable
     unsupported features, set the module parameter
     <literal>allow_unsupported=1</literal>
     in
     <filename>/etc/modprobe.d</filename>
     or write the value
     <literal>1</literal>

      /sys/module/
      <replaceable>MODULE_NAME</replaceable>
      /parameters/allow_unsupported

     However, note that setting this option will render your kernel and thus
     your system unsupported.
