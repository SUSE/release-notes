==== Lack of PMU support for Intel hybrid CPUs

Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) features do not function correctly on systems with Intel hybrid CPUs in this release.
The Linux kernel requires additional changes to fully support the PMU on these processors, which were only introduced in Linux kernel version 6.9.

Because {productnameshort} {this-version} is based on kernel 6.4, these improvements are not included.
