==== Comparison of Supported File Systems

{sle} was the first enterprise Linux distribution to support journaling file systems and logical volume managers back in 2000.
Later, we introduced XFS to Linux, which today is seen as the primary work horse for large-scale file systems, systems with heavy load and multiple parallel reading and writing operations.
With {sle} 12, we went the next step of innovation and started using the copy-on-write file system Btrfs as the default for the operating system, to support system snapshots and rollback.

^1^ OCFS 2 is fully supported as part of the {sleha}.

^2^ Btrfs is a copy-on-write file system.
Instead of journaling changes before writing them in-place, it writes them to a new location and then links the new location in.
Until the last write, the changes are not "committed".
Because of the nature of the file system, quotas are implemented based on subvolumes (`qgroups`).

^3^ To extend an OCFS 2 file system, the cluster must be online but the file system itself must be unmounted.

^4^ The block size default varies with different host architectures.
64{nbsp}KiB is used on POWER, 4{nbsp}KiB on other systems.
The actual size used can be checked with the command `getconf _PAGE_SIZE_`.

*Additional Notes*

Maximum file size above can be larger than the file system's actual size because of the use of sparse blocks.
All standard file systems on {sles} have LFS, which gives a maximum file size of 2^63^{nbsp}bytes in theory.

The numbers in the table above assume that the file systems are using a 4{nbsp}KiB block size which is the most common standard.
When using different block sizes, the results are different.

In this document:

* 1024{nbsp}Bytes = 1{nbsp}KiB
* 1024{nbsp}KiB = 1{nbsp}MiB;
* 1024{nbsp}MiB = 1{nbsp}GiB
* 1024{nbsp}GiB = 1{nbsp}TiB
* 1024{nbsp}TiB = 1{nbsp}PiB
* 1024{nbsp}PiB = 1{nbsp}EiB.

Some file system features are available in {sles} {this-version} but are not supported by {suse}.
By default, the file system drivers in {sles} {this-version} will refuse mounting file systems that use unsupported features (in particular, in read-write mode).
To enable unsupported features, set the module parameter `allow_unsupported=1` in `/etc/modprobe.d` or write the value `1` to `/sys/module/_MODULE_NAME_/parameters/allow_unsupported`.
However, note that setting this option will render your kernel and thus your system unsupported.

[#jsc-SLE-22662]
==== XFS V4 format file systems have been deprecated

Customers who have created XFS file system on {slea} 11 or prior will see the following message:
```
Deprecated V4 format (crc=0) will not be supported after September 2030
```

While the file system will work and be supported until the date mentioned, it is best to re-create the file system:

1. Backup all the data to another drive or partition
2. Create the file system on the device
3. Restore the data from the backup
