[#technology-preview]
=== Technology previews

Technology previews are packages, stacks, or features delivered by SUSE to provide glimpses into upcoming innovations. Technology previews are included for your convenience to give you a chance to test new technologies within your environment. We would appreciate your feedback! If you test a technology preview, contact your SUSE representative and let them know about your experience and use cases. Your input is helpful for future development.

Technology previews come with the following limitations:

* Technology previews are still in development. Therefore, they may be functionally incomplete, unstable, or in other ways not suitable for production use.
* Technology previews are not supported.
* Technology previews may only be available for specific hardware architectures. Details and functionality of technology previews are subject to change. As a result, upgrading to subsequent releases of a technology preview may be impossible and require a fresh installation.
* Technology previews can be removed from a product at any time. This may be the case, for example, if SUSE discovers that a preview does not meet the customer or market needs, or does not comply with enterprise standards.

[#bsc-1249039]
==== `lklfuse`

As technology preview, `lklfuse` is available in {productname} {this-version}.

`lklfuse` is intentionally built without Btrfs support.
Btrfs filesystems can be multi-device (for example, RAID1) but `lklfuse` currently only supports a single device per mount.


=== Changes affecting all architectures

// jsc#PED-4971
* `NetworkManager` is now the only network configuration stack in {productname} {this-version}.

// copied from 15 SP7, see bsc-1237496
[#jsc-PED-4963]
==== systemd default configurations moved to `/usr`

Main configuration files have been moved from `/etc` to `/usr`.
This ensures that main configuration files have lower precedence, allowing them to be overriden by package-supplied drop-in snippets.

Local configuration should be created by either modifying the default file in `/usr` (or a copy of it placed in `/etc` if the original file is shipped in `/usr`), or by creating drop-in snippets in the appropriate directory in (for example, `/etc/systemd/coredump.conf.d/`) - this is recommended.

Remove configurations in `/etc` to restore defaults.

[#jsc-PED-11998]

==== Lightweight guard region support

This is a new feature in `madvise()` that installs a lightweight guard region into a specified address range.

See https://manpages.opensuse.org/Leap-16.0/man-pages/madvise.2.en.html#MADV_GUARD_INSTALL[madvise() man page] for more information.


// also jsc#DOCTEAM-1949
[#bsc-1244716]
==== Harmless error messages sometimes displayed when launching some applications

The following messages are sometimes displayed when launching specific applications:

1. `gnome-desktop` some times failes to create transient scope:
[source]
> gnome-session-binary: GnomeDesktop-WARNING: Could not create transient scope for PID 7883: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnixProcessIdUnknown: Process with ID 7883 does not exist.

2. `systemd` sometimes failes to assign cgroup:
[source]
> systemd: app-gnome-gnome\x2dkeyring\x2dpkcs11-6708.scope: Couldn't move process 6708 to requested cgroup '/user.slice/user-0.slice/user@0.service/app.slice/app-gnome-gnome\x2dkeyring\x2dpkcs11-6708.scope': No such process
> systemd: app-gnome-gnome\x2dkeyring\x2dpkcs11-6708.scope: Failed to add PIDs to scope's control group: No such process
> systemd: app-gnome-gnome\x2dkeyring\x2dpkcs11-6708.scope: Failed with result 'resources'.
> systemd: Failed to start Application launched by gnome-session-binary.

These messages are harmless and can be ignored.


[#jsc-PED-13449]
==== NFS over TLS support

NFS over TLS is now supported for storage traffic.


[#jsc-PED-13396]
==== `saptune` replaces `sapconf`

In {productnameshort} {this-version}, `sapconf` is replaced with `saptune`.
`saptune` will also be enabled with a base tuning, similar to `sapconf`.
Base tuning only will be enabled if `saptune` was not configured before (no SAP Notes or Solutions selected).


[#jsc-PED-12925]
==== Azure Entra ID authentication via `himmelblau`

The `himmelblau` package has been added.
It provides interoperability with for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune.
It supports Linux authentication to Microsoft Azure Entra ID via PAM and NSS modules.

For more information see https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau.


[#jsc-PED-12206]
==== Legacy BIOS support

Legacy BIOS is still supported in {productname} {this-version}.
However, some features are not available when using it (for example, full-disk encryption with TPM).
Finally, support for legacy BIOS will be discontinued in the future.
For that reason we recommend switching to UEFI at the nearest opportunity.

==== `/tmp` not persistent

In {productname} {this-version}, `/tmp` is no longer persistent between reboots but uses `tmpfs` instead.
See https://susedoc.github.io/doc-modular/main/html/SLE-comparison/index.html#sle16-tmp for more information.


[#jsc-PED-12752]
==== Python update strategy

* `/usr/bin/python3` is currently set to use Python 3.13. In a future minor version update this is likely going to be changed to a newer Python version.
* {productname} {this-version} contains around 700 popular Python packages, which form a basic set of functionality for packages that depends on Python and for developing apps without needing to install Python modules from an external provider.
* We have been working on removing the dependencies of packages and tools on the `/usr/bin/python3` binary, which means that {productname} could use a newer version of the Python interpreter in the future. This new Python interpreter will coexist with the previous version that will then be maintained as legacy interpreter for a limited time.


[#jsc-PED-12715]
==== Removal of 32-bit support

{productname} {this-version} only supports 64-bit binaries.
Support for 32-bit binaries (or 31-bit binaries on {ibmz}) has been removed.

This means that statically-linked 32-bit binaries (or 31-bit binaries on {ibmz}) and container images cannot be run anymore.
32-bit syscalls are still enabled by default on arm64, and can be enabled on x86_64 via the kernel parameter `ia32_emulation`.
On other architectures it's disabled without any option to enable it.


[#jsc-PED-12734]
==== Compiling kernel uses non-default compiler

Customers who need to build kernel modules or rebuild the kernel must use the same compiler version the kernel was built with.
The kernel is built with `gcc` version 13, which is not the default compiler.
Install the gcc version 13 compiler using the `gcc13` package and invoke it with the command `gcc-13`.
This specific compiler version is only supported for building kernel modules and the kernel.


[#jsc-PED-12297]
==== Optimized libraries for newer hardware architectures

We have added support for the glibc-HWCAPS feature which loads optimized versions of libraries for specific newer CPUs automatically.

The build infrastructure for this feature is enabled for the following libraries:

* `blosc2`
* `boost`
* `brotli`
* `bzip2`
* `flac`
* `jsoncpp`
* `lame`
* `leveldb`
* `libdb-4_8`
* `libgcrypt`
* `libiscsi`
* `libjpeg-turbo`
* `libjxl`
* `libmng`
* `libnettle`
* `libpng16`
* `libvorbis`
* `libxmlb`
* `lz4`
* `lzo`
* `openjpeg2`
* `openssl-3`
* `python311`
* `python313`
* `sqlite3`
* `talloc`
* `tree-sitter`
* `wavpack`
* `xxhash`
* `xz`
* `zlib`
* `zopfli`
* `zstd`


[#bsc-1240889]
==== No remote `root` login with password

[WARNING]
If you install the system using only a `root` password and do not provide an SSH key for the root user, `sshd` will not be enabled automatically after installation.
You will not be able to log in remotely as root using the password.

By default, remote password-based `root` login is disabled.
The installer enables the `sshd` service only when an SSH key for root is configured during setup.
To allow remote `root` login, configure an SSH key for root during installation.

include::../shared.adoc[tags=bsc1240989,leveloffset=+3]

[#jsc-PED-12156]
==== SysV init.d scripts support

SysV init.d scripts have been https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/x86_64/SUSE-SLES/15-SP2/index.html#jsc-SLE-7690[deprecated since {productnameshort} 15 SP2].

In {productnameshort} {this-version}, support of SysV init.d scripts has been removed.


=== Changes affecting all architectures (RC1)

This section contains information specific to RC1.
We are working on fixing the problems mentioned here.
The content of this section will be removed for the final released product.

[#jsc-PED-12189]
==== `/etc/services` removal

The `/etc/services` file is just a dummy file that will be removed in the future.
Software that appends to it without creating it should have its behavior changed.


=== Changes affecting all architectures (Beta4)

This section contains information specific to Beta4.
We are working on fixing the problems mentioned here.
The content of this section will be removed for the final released product.

[#jsc-DOCTEAM-1848]
==== Configuring network interfaces during installation

Currently, the installer does not allow for setting up network interfaces using the UI.
However, in the meantime you can use dracut-like command-line options, for example:

[source]
ifname=<interface>:<MAC>
ip=<interface>:dhcp

Additionally, the `inst.copy_network` is not available in Beta4.

// also bsc#12244703
[#jsc-DOCTEAM-1829]
==== {sap} workloads on {productnameshort} {this-version}

For running {sap} workloads on {productname} {this-version}, do the following:

1. Unpack the {sap} installer.
2. Run the following commands to change policies:
[source,bash]
semanage boolean -m --on selinuxuser_execmod
semanage boolean -m --on unconfined_service_transition_to_unconfined_user
semanage permissive -a snapper_grub_plugin_t
restorecon -R /
3. Run the following commands to lable all files:
[source,bash]
test -d ./snapshots && restorecon -R / -e /.snapshots
test -d ./snapshots || restorecon R /
4. Install {sap} workload or {hana}
5. Label all files again:
[source,bash]
test -d /.snapshots && restorecon -R / -e /.snapshots
test -d /.snapshots || restorecon -R /

==== FIPS 140-3 not working properly

FIPS 140-3 installation has not been fully validated and may cause unexpected software failure or crashes. Therefore, we discourage you from using it on Beta4.

=== Changes affecting all architectures (Beta3)

This section contains information specific to Beta3.
We are working on fixing the problems mentioned here.
The content of this section will be removed for the final released product.

[#bsc-1240945]
==== Kernel crash in QEMU

{productname} {this-version} requires a CPU that supports a so-called "x86-64-v2" microarchitecture.
Due to this, running a {productnameshort} image using QEMU currently results in a kernel crash.

As a workaround you can run QEMU with the `-cpu host` argument.


[#jsc-DOCTEAM-1849]
==== Missing `libnsl.so.1` library

The `libnsl.so.1` library has been deprecated in {slesa} 15 and finally removed in {productname} {this-version}.

As a workaround for applications that cannot be installed without it (but presumaly do not use it for anything), we provide the `libnsl-stub1` package that includes ABI-compatible but otherwise function-less stub of the library file.


[#jsc-DOCTEAM-1767]
==== `firewalld` not usable with many interfaces

Due to an upstream bug, `firewalld` might take a long time or time out when adding many interfaces.
The error occurs when `firewalld` is restarted after applying such a configuration.
The following message appears in the system logs:
[source]
ERROR:dbus.proxies:Introspect error on :1.18:/org/fedoraproject/FirewallD1: dbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply.
Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.

See https://github.com/firewalld/firewalld/issues/1399 for more information.


=== Changes affecting all architectures (Beta2)

This section contains information specific to Beta2.
We are working on fixing the problems mentioned here.
The content of this section will be removed for the final released product.

[#bsc-1237605]
==== Switch from YaST to Cockpit

{productname} {this-version} has switched from {yast} to Cockpit for manual system administration.
We have enhanced Cockpit with new modules with the intention to upstream them later.
Despite being functional, bugs might appear and features might be missing.

*New modules*

* `cockpit-subscriptions`: register, de-register and view {sle} registrations.
Does not work for unprivileged users yet.
* `cockpit-repositories`: add, remove, view repositories, change settings and refresh them.
Does not work for unprivileged users yet.
* `cockpit-packages`: show installed packages, search available repositories, install and uninstall packages.
Requires administrative access.
Be aware that there are no safety measures implemented as far as system usability goes.

*Enhanced modules*

* `cockpit-packagekit`: update packages from available repositories.
The module now allows to individually select packages to update.

*Upstream modules*

`cockpit`, `cockpit-bridge`, `cockpit-kdump`, `cockpit-machines`, `cockpit-networkmanager`, `cockpit-podman`, `cockpit-selinux`, `cockpit-storaged`, `cockpit-system`, `cockpit-ws`: these modules are updated to the recent stable base version 332 (or their respective).

*Default selection*

Installation of the pattern `cockpit` will pull in the following modules: `cockpit`, `cockpit-bridge`, `cockpit-networkmanager`, `cockpit-packagekit`, `cockpit-packages`, `cockpit-repos`, `cockpit-selinux`, `cockpit-storaged`, `cockpit-subscriptions`, `cockpit-system`, `cockpit-ws`.


[#jsc-DOCTEAM-1714]
==== `dovecot` 2.4 configuration upgrade

In {productname} {this-version} `dovecot` has been upgraded to version 2.4.
The configuration of this version is incompatible with the previous versions.

Configuration has to be updated manually.
For more information see https://doc.dovecot.org/2.4.0/installation/upgrade/2.3-to-2.4.html.


=== Changes affecting all architectures (Beta1)

This section contains information specific to Beta1.
We are working on fixing the problems mentioned here.

[#bsc-1235855]
==== Disk configuration UI during installation

Currently, choosing disk configurations other than "An existing disk" (installation to a single disk) suffer from poor usability.
This is expected to change in a future update.


[#bsc-1236813]
==== Non-functioning `zypper` after installation

There is currently a known issue that adds a non-functioning `zypper` repository which prevents `zypper` from working correctly.

To fix this issue, remove the repository in question and add the installation medium repository manually:

1. Remove repository with `zypper rr`. To remove the first repository, for example, run: `zypper rr 1`.
2. Add the installation medium as repository by running `zypper ar hd:/install?device=/dev/disk/by-label/agama-installer  medium` (the `medium` at the end is a name you want to give the repository).
3. Run `zypper refresh` to refresh the added repository.


[#jsc-PED-6311]

[#bsc-1235858]
===== `parmfile` now points to ISO

Previously, `parmfile` would point to a directory of unpacked files.

Now it need to point to a loop-mounted ISO via FTP.
For example:

[source]
root=live:ftp://$SERVER_URL/install/agama-online.iso
agama.install_url=ftp://$SERVER_URL/install/agama

For more information see https://agama-project.github.io/docs/user/boot_options.


[#bsc-1235857]
===== Disk selection UI problems during installation

If you want to enable a disk, click on _Storage_ in the left panel, then _Install new system on_ and choose "storage techs".
Then you can choose a type of disk.
This can be avoided if you have defined your `parmfile` as described in <<bsc-1235858>>.

If you choose DASD, you should see disks based on your `parmfile` and `cio_ignore` configuration.
Then choose a disk and activate it by clicking _Perform an action_ and then _Activate_.
This can take a moment.
If it is not visible, then you need to click on Storage or refresh the page.

In the _zFCP_ section, after activating a disk a gray line will appear.
This is just a visual bug, the disk will activate correctly.


===== Installation failure on zVM

Due to a change from `linuxrc` to `dracut`, the `parmfile` needs to define not only installation source but also a network and disks.

The `parmfile` needs to be filled with a `dracut`-like options, for example:

[source]
root=live:ftp://$SERVER_URL/install/online.iso
ip=$IP_address::$IP_gateway:24:SLE16-Beta4:$NETWORK_DEVICE:none
rd.zdev=qeth,0.0.0800:0.0.0801:0.0.0802,layer2=1,portno=0
cio_ignore=all,!condev,!0.0.0160 nameserver=$NAMEserverIP
live.password=linux rd.zdev=dasd,0.0.0160

=== POWER-specific changes (ppc64le)

Information in this section applies to {power-productname} {this-version}.

[#jsc-PED-12179]
==== KVM guests in LPAR

The ability to run KVM Guests in an LPAR is a new feature in PowerVM Firmware 1060.10 release and supported in {productname} {this-version}.
This enables users to run KVM guests in a PowerVM LPAR bringing industry standard Linux KVM virtualization stack to IBM PowerVM, which easily integrates with existing Linux virtualization ecosystem.
This enables a lot of interesting usecases which were earlier difficult to realize in a PowerVM LPAR.

KVM in a PowerVM LPAR is a new type of LPAR (logical partition) that allows the {productname} {this-version} kernel to host KVM guests inside an LPAR on PowerVM.
A KVM enabled LPAR allows standard Linux KVM tools (for example, `virsh`) to create and manage lightweight Linux Virtual Machines (VM).
A KVM Linux LPAR uses dedicated cores which enables Linux to have full control of when Linux VMs are scheduled to run, just like KVM on other platforms.

===== Intel TDX Confidential Computing

In {productname} {this-version} the kernel now incorporates the latest upstream Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) patches. This significant update prepares the virtualization toolstack for Intel TDX confidential computing capabilities.

These patches are important for enabling the kernel to support creating and managing trust domains, which is a step towards enabling confidential computing environments on Intel TDX-enabled hardware.

[NOTE]
The full Intel TDX confidential computing experience also requires integrating QEMU and libvirt components, which will be part of a future update.

===== Enhanced VM Security with AMD SEV-SNP

AMD SEV-SNP (Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging) is a hardware security feature in AMD EPYC processors that provides a highly secure and confidential environment for virtual machines (VMs). It offers strong memory confidentiality through per-VM encryption keys and AES encryption, and crucially, robust memory integrity protection to prevent tampering from the hypervisor or other threats. It also provides enhanced isolation and remote attestation capabilities, making it ideal for protecting sensitive data and workloads in untrusted environments like cloud computing.
This release fully integrates AMD SEV-SNP for KVM-based virtual machines. This means integrated support in our kernel, along with updated QEMU, Libvirt, and OVMF Firmware.
To use AMD SEV-SNP, you'll need, AMD EPYC™ 3rd Gen Processors (Milan) or newer and SEV-SNP enabled in your system's BIOS/UEFI.

===== virt-bridge-setup

virt-bridge-setup is a script designed to simplify network bridge creation on a specified interface using nmcli. It was developed as a replacement for the automatic "yast2 virtualization" bridge creation and is particularly useful for setting up virtualization environments.

Important considerations:

* It supports IPv4 only.
* This is a simple script not intended for complex network scenarios (vlan, bonding, etc...); manual bridge setup is recommended for intricate configurations.
* The script should be run locally (not remotely) immediately after installation and before any custom network configurations.
