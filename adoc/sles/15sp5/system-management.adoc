[#jsc-PED-7978]
==== Effective user limits in systemd setup

Before, the lookup of the effective session limit in a systemd setup was not trivial.
Now these new properties have been added:

* `EffectiveMemoryMax`
* `EffectiveMemoryHigh`
* `EffectiveTasksMax`


[#jsc-PED-407]
==== Silence `KillMode=None` messages

The log level of the deprecation warnings regarding `killmode=None` have been reduced.
Instead of `warning`, they are now logged at the `debug` log level.


[#bsc-1204978]
==== `yast2-iscsi-client` drops `open-iscsi` and `iscsiuio` as dependencies

The `yast2-iscsi-client` package no longer automatically installs `open-iscsi` and `iscsiuio`.
The two packages need to be installed manually before using `yast2-iscsi-client`.

[#jsc-SLE-7690]
==== Support for System V init.d scripts is deprecated

systemd in {productname} {this-version} automatically converts System V `init.d` scripts to service files.
Support for System V init.d scripts is deprecated and will be removed with the next major version of {productname}.
In the next major version of {productname}, systemd will also stop converting System V `init.d` scripts to systemd service files.

To prepare for this change, use the automatically generated systemd service files directly instead of using System V `init.d` scripts.
To do so, copy the generated service files to `/etc/systemd/system`.
To then control the associated services, use `systemctl`.

The automatic conversion provided by systemd (specifically, `systemd-sysv-generator`) is only meant to ensure backward compatibility with System V init.d scripts.
To take full advantage of systemd features, it can be beneficial to manually rewrite the service files.

This deprecation also causes the following changes:

// jsc#SLE-7192
* The `/etc/init.d/halt.local` initscript is deprecated.
Use systemd service files instead.
// jsc#SLE-10912
* `rc__SERVICE__` controls of systemd services are deprecated.
Use systemd service files instead.
// jsc#SLE-9004
* `insserv.conf` is deprecated.


// !STICKY
[#zypper-search-packages]
==== Searching packages across all {slea} modules

In {slea} {this-version} you can search for packages both within and outside of currently enabled {slea} modules using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
zypper search-packages -d SEARCH_TERM
----

This command contacts the SCC and searches all modules for matching packages.
This functionality makes it easier for administrators and system architects to find the software packages needed.
