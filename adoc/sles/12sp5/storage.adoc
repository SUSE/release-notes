==== XFS V4 format file systems have been deprecated

Customers who have created XFS file system on {slea} 11 or prior will see the following message:
```
Deprecated V4 format (crc=0) will not be supported after September 2030
```

While the file system will work and be supported until the date mentioned, it is best to re-create the file system:

1. Backup all the data to another drive or partition
2. Create the file system on the device
3. Restore the data from the backup
