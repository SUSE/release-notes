   <title>Migrating SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2 with WebYaST
   Installed via wagon</title>

   <para>
    For migrating SLES11-SP2 with WebYaST installed to SP3 via wagon, it
    is necessary to install the WebYaST product metadata before starting
    the migration.  To do so, make sure the packages
    "sle-11-SP2-WebYaST-release" and "sle-11-SP2-WebYaST-release-cd" are
    installed. You can ignore, if wagon reports an unknown registration
    status of WebYaST at the beginning of the migration.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     Without the WebYaST product metadata installed, WebYaST will not be
     migrated.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    The product metadata are not needed when upgrading SLES via booting the
    installation media.
