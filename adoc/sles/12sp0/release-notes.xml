     Technology previews are packages, stacks, or features delivered by
     SUSE. These features are not supported. They may be functionally
     incomplete, unstable or in other ways not suitable for production use.
     They are mainly included for customer convenience and give customers a
     chance to test new technologies within an enterprise environment.
    </para>
    <para>
     Whether a technical preview will be moved to a fully supported package
     later, depends on customer and market feedback. A technical preview
     does not automatically result in support at a later point in time.
     Technical previews could be dropped at any time and SUSE is not
     committed to provide a technical preview later in the product cycle.

     <para>
      VMCS Shadowing is a new VT-x feature that allows software in VMX
      non-root operation to execute the VMREAD and VMWRITE instructions.
      Such executions do not read from the current VMCS (the one supporting
      VMX non-root operation) but instead from a shadow VMCS. This feature
      will help improve nested virtualization performance. VMCS shadowing is

     <para>
      The experimental QEMU TPM passthrough feature should not be used in

        <literal>/boot/grub2/grub.cfg</literal>. Be aware that YaST
        autogenerates this configuration file. Thus better use the Kernel

     <title>Memory Compression with zswap</title>
     <para>
      <emphasis>Usually, when a system's physical memory is exceeded, the
      system moves some memory onto reserved space on a hard drive, called
      "swap" space. This frees physical memory space for additional use.
      However, this process of "swapping" memory onto (and back from) a hard
      drive is much, much slower than direct memory access, so it can slow
      down the entire system.</emphasis>
     </para>
     <para>
      Starting with SLES 12, you can enable the <literal>zswap</literal>
      driver using the boot parameter <literal>zswap.enabled=1</literal>.
      The <literal>zswap</literal> driver inserts itself between the system
      and the swap hard drive, and instead of writing memory to a hard
      drive, it compresses memory. This speeds up both writing to swap and
      reading from swap, which results in better overall system performance
      while using swap.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Compression Limits</emphasis>
     </para>
     <para>
      The effective compression ratio cannot exceed 50 percent, that is, it
      can at most store two uncompressed pages in one compressed page.If the
      workload's compression ratio exceeds 50% for all pages,
      <literal>zswap</literal> will not be able to save any memory.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold"> Setting <literal>zswap</literal> Memory
      </emphasis>
     </para>
     <para>
      Compressed memory still uses a certain amount of memory, so
      <literal>zswap</literal> has a limit to the amount of memory which
      will be stored compressed, which is controllable through the file
      <literal>/sys/module/zswap/parameters/max_pool_percent</literal>. By
      default, this is set to <literal>20</literal>, which indicates
      <literal>zswap</literal> will use 20 percent of the total system
      physical memory to store compressed memory.
     </para>
     <para>
      The <literal>zswap</literal> memory limit has to be carefully
      configured. Setting the limit too high can lead to premature
      out-of-memory situations that would not exist without
      <literal>zswap</literal>, if the memory is filled by non-swappable
      non-reclaimable pages. This includes mlocked memory and pages locked
      by drivers and other kernel users.
     </para>
     <para>
      For the same reason, performance can also be hurt by
      compression/decompression if the current workload's workset would fit
      in, for example, 90 percent of the available RAM, but 20 percent of
      RAM is already occupied by <literal>zswap</literal>. This means that
      the missing 10 percent of uncompressed RAM would constantly be swapped
      out of/in to the memory area compressed by <literal>zswap</literal>,
      while the rest of the memory compressed by <literal>zswap</literal>
      would hold pages that were swapped out earlier which are currently
      unused. There is no mechanism that would result in gradual writeback
      of those unused pages to let the uncompressed memory grow.

        The configured memory limit for <literal>zswap</literal> is

        are written back to disk-based swap (that is, LRU).

     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Memory Allocation Issues</emphasis>
     </para>
     <para>
      In theory, it can happen that <literal>zswap</literal> is not yet
      exceeding its memory limit, but already fails to allocate memory to
      store compressed pages. In that case, it will refuse to compress any
      new pages and they will be swapped to disk immediately. For
      confirmation whether this issue is occurring, check the value of
      <literal>/sys/kernel/debug/zswap/reject_alloc_fail</literal>.

      You can limit the amount of page cache that the kernel uses if there
      is competition between application memory and page cache. Once the

      more important and should not be paged out.

     <para>
      No pages will be paged out if the memory footprint of the workload
      plus the configured page cache limit do not exceed the amount of
      physical RAM in the system. If paging needs to occur, the Linux kernel
      will still favor to keep application memory over page cache unless we
      are below the page cache limit.
     </para>
     <para>
      If there is plenty of free memory, the kernel will continue to use it
      as page cache in order to speed up file system operations.

     To work around this behavior, disable the installation of recommended

    <title>Updating Registration Status After Rollback</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>When performing a service pack migration, it is necessary to
     change the configuration on the registration server to provide access
     to the new repositories. If the migration process is interrupted or
     reverted (via restoring from a backup or snapshot), the information on
     the registration server is inconsistent with the status of the system.
     This may lead to you being prevented from accessing update repositories
     or to wrong repositories being used on the client.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     When a rollback is done via Snapper, the system will notify the
     registration server to ensure access to the correct repositories is set
     up during the boot process. If the system was restored any other way or
     the communication with the registration server failed for any reason
     (for example, because the server was not accessible due to network
     issues), trigger the rollback on the client manually by calling
     <literal>snapper rollback</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     We suggest always checking that the correct repositories are set up on
     the system, especially after refreshing the service using

     <title>Ext4: Experimental Features</title>
     <para>
      Ext4 has some features that are under development and still
      experimental. Thus, using these features poses a significant risk to
      data. To clearly indicate such features, the Ext4 driver in SUSE Linux
      Enterprise 12 refuses to mount (or mount read-write) file systems with
      such features. To mount such file systems set the
      <literal>allow_unsupported</literal> module parameter (either when
      loading the module or via
      <literal>/sys/module/ext4/parameters/allow_unsupported</literal>).
      However setting this option will render your kernel, and thus your
      system unsupported.
     </para>

      Features which are treated this way are: bigalloc, metadata
      checksumming, and journal checksumming.

     <title>Preparation for Non-linear Memory Mapping Deprecation</title>
     <para>
      Non-linear mappings are considered for deprecation in upstream as part
      of code cleanup. Of course, the existing syscall API
      (remap_file_pages) will stay and will be implemented as an emulation
      on top of regular mmap interface. To ensure a stable kernel
      application binary interface (kABI) during SLE 12 lifetime, SUSE is
      preparing this change. As a result, the first use of the syscall will
      trigger a warning and the module source code will not compile without
      modification. If your software encounters this condition, get in touch
      with your SUSE contact to get support during migration.

     <title>Basic Linux-Integrity Enablement (IMA, IMA-Appraisal, EVM)</title>
     <para>
      IMA, IMA-appraisal, and EVM are configured in SLES-12, but not enabled

     <para>
      IMA can be used to attest a system's runtime integrity. IMA
      measurements are enabled with the boot parameter
      <literal>ima_tcb</literal>. This starts a built-in policy which
      measures all regular files that are executed or read by a process with
      root uid. The built-in policy can be replaced with a custom policy.
      For more information, see
      <ulink url="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ABI/testing/ima_policy">https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ABI/testing/ima_policy</ulink>.
     </para>
     <para>
      In order to enforce local file integrity, the file system is labeled
      with good measurements (for example hash, signature). IMA appraisal
      verifies the current measurement of a file matches the good value. If
      the values do not match, access to the file is denied. For more
      information on creating public/private keys used for signing files,
      loading the public key on the IMA keyring, and labeling the
      filesystem, see

     <title>Change of Default Locations for Root Certificates</title>
     <para>
      <emphasis>Using /etc/ssl/certs or even a single bundle file to store

     <title>Intel 10GbE PCI Express Adapters: Setting MAC Address of a VF Interface</title>

      When using the ixgbe and ixgbevf drivers (Intel 10GbE PCI Express

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        through the PF: This would typically be done on the virtualization
        host using a command such as <literal>ip link set p4p1 vf 0 mac

       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
     <para>
      Initially, either methods are permitted. However, after the
      administrator has explicitly configured a MAC address for a VF through
      its PF, the ixgbe driver disallows further changes of the MAC address
      through the VF. For example, if an attempt is made to change the MAC
      address through the VF on a guest after the MAC address for this
      device has been set on the host, the host will log a warning of the
      following form:
     </para>
<screen>[  884.838134] ixgbe 0000:08:00.0: p4p1: VF 0 attempted to override administratively set MAC address

     <para>
      To avoid this problem, either avoid configuring an address for the VF
      through the PF (on the virtualization host) and let a trusted guest
      set whatever MAC address is desired, or set the desired MAC address
      through the PF such that further changes through the VF are not

     <para>
      If you install the updated package on a system where the SLES 12 GA
      version is not installed, the new preset is in place, this means "use
      socket activation for uuidd" is applied during the installation and
      the service works out of the box.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you update the package on a system where the SLES 12 GA version is
      installed, the new preset is not enforced. This means the old setting

     libzypp-14.39.0 will per default check a downloaded rpm packages
     signature, if the corresponding repositories metadata are not gpg
     signed or the signature was not verified.
    </para>
    <para>
     Customers using unsigned repositories may experience that zypper/yast
     now ask whether to accept a package whose signature can not be checked
     because the signing key is not known [4-Signatures public key is not
     available]:
    </para>
<screen>(1/1) zypper-1.12.3-3.2.x86_64(myrepo) .....................&lt;100%&gt;[|]
zypper-1.12.3-3.2.x86_64.rpm:
    Header V3 DSA/SHA1 Signature, key ID f3ef3328: NOKEY
    V3 DSA/SHA1 Signature, key ID f3ef3328: NOKEY

zypper-1.12.3-3.2.x86_64(myrepo): Signature verification failed [4-Signatures public key is not available]
Abort, retry, ignore? [a/r/i] (a):</screen>
    <para>
     Ignoring the error will install the package despite the failed
     signature verification. It's not recommended to chose this option
     unless it's known, that the gpgkey (with key ID &lt;as displayed&gt;)
     which was used to sign the package is trusted (but it was not imported
     into the rpm database).
    </para>
    <para>
     The message can be avoided by manually importing the missing trusted
     key into the rpm database (using 'rpmkeys --import' PUBKEY ).
    </para>
    <para>
     Other signature verification errors than [4-Signatures public key is
     not available] should not be ignored.
    </para>
    <para>
     Customers using only signed repositories should experience no
     difference.
    </para>
    <para>
     The default of checking either the repo metadata signature or the rpm
     packages signatures can be tuned globally (in
     <literal>/etc/zypp.conf</literal>) or per repo (editing the
     corresponding .repo file in <literal>/etc/zypp/repos.d</literal>).
     Explicitly setting repo_gpgcheck or pkg_gpgcheck will overwrite the
     defaults.
    </para>
<screen>[zypp.conf]
## Signature checking (repodata and rpm packages)
##
##   boolean    gpgcheck        (default: on)
##   boolean    repo_gpgcheck   (default: unset -&gt; according to gpgcheck)
##   boolean    pkg_gpgcheck    (default: unset -&gt; according to gpgcheck)
##
## If 'gpgcheck' is 'on' we will either check the signature of repo metadata
## (packages are secured via checksum in the metadata), or the signature of
## a rpm package to install if it's repo metadata are not signed or not
## checked.
##
## The default behavior can be altered by explicitly setting 'repo_gpgcheck' and/or
## 'pkg_gpgcheck' to perform those checks always (if 'on') or never (if 'off').
##
## Explicitly setting 'gpgcheck', 'repo_gpgcheck' 'pkg_gpgcheck' in a
## repositories .repo file will overwrite the defaults here.
##
##   DISABLING GPG CHECKS IS NOT RECOMMENDED.
##   Signing data enables the recipient to verify that no modifications
##   occurred after the data were signed. Accepting data with no, wrong
##   or unknown signature can lead to a corrupted system and in extreme
##   cases even to a system compromise.

    <title>New XFS On-disk Format</title>
    <para>
     SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 supports the new <literal>on-disk
     format</literal> (v5) of the XFS file system. XFS file systems created
     by YaST will use this new format. The main advantages of this format
     are automatic checksumming of all XFS metadata, file type support, and
     support for a larger number of access control lists for a file.
    </para>
    <para>
     Caveat: Pre SLE 12 kernels, <literal>xfsprogs</literal> before version
     3.2.0, and the grub2 bootloader before the one released in SLE 12 do
     not understand the new file system format and thus refuse to work with
     it. This can be problematic if the file system should also be used from
     older or other distribution.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you require interoperability of the XFS file system with older or
     other distributions, format the filesystem manually using the
     <literal>mkfs.xfs</literal> command. That will create a filesystem in
     the old format unless you use the <literal>"-m crc=1"</literal> option.

    <title>Using the "noop" I/O Scheduler for Multipathing and Virtualization Guests</title>
    <para>
     For advanced storage configurations like 4-way multipath to an array,
     we will end up with an environment where the host OS is scheduling I/O
     and the storage array is scheduling I/O. It is a common occurrence that
     those schedulers end up competing with each other and ultimately
     degrade performance. Because the storage array has the best view of
     what the storage is doing at any given time, enabling the
     <literal>noop</literal> scheduler on the host is telling the OS to just
     get out of the way and let the array handle all of the scheduling.
    </para>
    <para>
     Following the same rationale, also for block devices within
     virtualization guests the <literal>noop</literal> I/O scheduler should
     be used.
    </para>

     To change the I/O scheduler for a specific block device, use:

     Migration from existing "Ext" file systems (Ext2, Ext3, ext4) and
     Reiserfs is supported "offline" and "in place", if the original
     filesystem has been created with a 4k block size (this is the case for
     most file systems on the x86-64 and System z architectures). Calling
     "btrfs-convert &lt;device&gt;" will convert the file system. This is an
     offline process, which needs at least 15% free space on the device, but
     is applied in place. Roll back: calling "btrfs-convert -r
     &lt;device&gt;" will roll back.
     <emphasis role="bold">Caveat:</emphasis> when rolling back, all data
     will be lost that has been added after the conversion into Btrfs; in

    <title>Default File System</title>
    <para>
     With SUSE Linux Enterprise 12, the default file system in new
     installations was changed from Ext3 to Btrfs for the root system
     partition. XFS is the default file system for the
     <literal>/home</literal> partition and other data partitions.
    </para>

     <emphasis role="bold">POWER Architecture</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     On POWER, the pagesize is 64K. Due to the assumption made by Btrfs
     regarding data blocksize (i.e. data blocksize being equal to the page
     size), a Btrfs installation on POWER will use a blocksize of 64K. This
     means that a Btrfs created on x86 will not be mountable and readable
     via Btrfs on POWER, and vice versa.
    </para>

    <title>Dynamic Aggregation of LVM Metadata via lvmetad</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Most LVM commands require an accurate view of the LVM
     metadata stored on the disk devices in the system. With the current LVM
     design, if this information is not available, LVM must scan all the

     of I/O operations in systems with a large number of disks.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     The purpose of the lvmetad daemon is to eliminate the need for this
     scanning by dynamically aggregating metadata information each time the

     udev rules. If lvmetad is not running, LVM performs a normal scan.

     <title>Paravirtualization Random Number Generators</title>
     <para>
      Virtual appliances need a good source of entropy, for instance when
      generating key material during installation. Without any physical
      source of entropy (like disk interrupts) such operations may take a
      rather long time. One way to improve the situation in the future may
      be to include PV drivers that expose hardware RNGs to the guest, such
      as <literal>virtio-rng</literal>.

      Support will be provided to limit QEMU to only the system calls that

    <title>Support of "Movable Memory" in NUMA Systems</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Memory that exists since boot is always managed by the NUMA
     zone ZONE_NORMAL. This memory has kernel memory, thus cannot be
     offlined, and subsequently cannot be hot-removed. One solution for this
     issue is to gather kernel memory on a special system board, and movable
     memory to other system boards.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     To achieve this behaviour, use the kernel commandline option
     <literal>movable_node</literal>. If this boot option is set, Linux
     checks the hot-pluggable bit of Memory Structure Affinity in the ACPI
     SRAT Table; if this bit is enabled, the memory is managed by
     ZONE_MOVABLE, and thus the other system boards can be hot-removed.
    </para>
    <para>
     CAVEAT: this boot option may have significant performance impact.
     Workloads that are very metadata intensive may not be able to use all
     memory because the bulk of memory is ZONE_MOVABLE. They will either
     suffer severely degraded performance or at the worst case, the OOM
     killer will fire. Similarly, workloads that require large amounts of
     address space may fail because they cannot allocate page tables. On
     NUMA machines, such workloads may still suffer degraded performance
     because all their page table pages are allocated remote to the
     workload.
    </para>
    <para>
     Enabling the feature will also limit the availability of system memory
     for certain features, eg. tmpfs may only be using memory from
     ZONE_NORMAL and memory in ZONE_MOVABLE will be unavailable.
    </para>
    <para>
     Summarizing, by enabling <literal>movable_node</literal> there is a
     trade-off between being able to hot-remove a full memory node versus
     workload performance, amount of memory that can be used and ability to
     even run a specific task. If you encounters one of the trade-offs, the
     only sensible option is to disable node memory hot-remove.

    <title>Firmware first mode for corrected errors</title>
    <para>
     SLES 12 kernel supports firmware first mode for corrected errors
     allowing firmware to take first control over memory error handling.
     Firmware then notifies Linux through APEI once memory errors exceed a
     platform defined threshold. On receipt of APEI notification, Linux
     immediately offlines pages in-kernel isolating problematic memory
     resulting in improved system reliability and uptime.

    <title>Upgrading PostgreSQL Installations from 9.1 to 9.4</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>To upgrade a PostgreSQL server installation from version 9.1
     to 9.4, the database files need to be converted to the new
     version.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     Note:<emphasis> System Upgrade from SLE 11 </emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis>On SLE 12, there are no PostgreSQL 8.4 or 9.1 packages. This
     means, you first must migrate PostgreSQL from 8.4 or 9.1 to 9.4 on SLE
     11 before upgrading the system from SLE 11 to SLE 12.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     Newer versions of PostgreSQL come with the
     <literal>pg_upgrade</literal> tool that simplifies and speeds up the
     migration of a PostgreSQL installation to a new version. Formerly, it
     was necessary to dump and restore the database files which was much
     slower.
    </para>
    <para>
     To work, <literal>pg_upgrade</literal> needs to have the server
     binaries of both versions available. To allow this, we had to change
     the way PostgreSQL is packaged as well as the naming of the packages,
     so that two or more versions of PostgreSQL can be installed in
     parallel.
    </para>
    <para>
     Starting with version 9.1, PostgreSQL package names on SUSE Linux
     Enterprise products contain numbers indicating the major version. In
     PostgreSQL terms, the major version consists of the first two
     components of the version number, for example, 9.1, 9.3, and 9.4. So,
     the packages for PostgreSQL 9.3 are named
     <literal>postgresql93</literal>,
     <literal>postgresql93-server</literal>, etc. Inside the packages, the
     files were moved from their standard location to a versioned location
     such as <literal>/usr/lib/postgresql93/bin</literal> or
     <literal>/usr/lib/postgresql94/bin</literal>. This avoids file
     conflicts if multiple packages are installed in parallel. The
     <literal>update-alternatives</literal> mechanism creates and maintains
     symbolic links that cause one version (by default the highest installed
     version) to re-appear in the standard locations. By default, database
     data is stored under <literal>/var/lib/pgsql/data</literal> on SUSE
     Linux Enterprise.
    </para>
    <para>
     The following preconditions have to be fulfilled before data migration
     can be started:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       If not already done, the packages of the old PostgreSQL version (9.3)
       must be upgraded to the latest release through a maintenance update.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The packages of the new PostgreSQL major version need to be
       installed. For SLE 12, this means installing
       <literal>postgresql94-server</literal> and all the packages it
       depends on. Because <literal>pg_upgrade</literal> is contained in the
       package <literal>postgresql94-contrib</literal>, this package must
       be installed as well, at least until the migration is done.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Unless <literal>pg_upgrade</literal> is used in link mode, the server
       must have enough free disk space to temporarily hold a copy of the
       database files. If the database instance was installed in the default
       location, the needed space in megabytes can be determined by running
       the following command as root: <literal>du -hs
       /var/lib/pgsql/data</literal>. If space is tight, it might help to
       run the <literal>VACUUM FULL</literal> SQL command on each database
       in the PostgreSQL instance to be migrated which might take very long.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     Upstream documentation about <literal>pg_upgrade</literal> including
     step-by-step instructions for performing a database migration can be

     With Apache 2.4, some changes have been introduced that affect Apache's

     "Require" directive. For backwards compatibility of 2.2 configurations,

    <title>Printing System: Improvements and Incompatible Changes</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">CUPS Version Upgrade to 1.7</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     CUPS &gt;= 1.6 has major incompatible changes compared to CUPS up to
     version 1.5.4 in particular when printing via network:
    </para>
    <para>
     The IPP protocol default version increased from 1.1 to 2.0. Older IPP
     servers like CUPS 1.3.x (for example in SLE 11) reject IPP 2.0 requests
     with "Bad Request" (see
     <ulink url="http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4231">http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4231</ulink>). By adding '/version=1.1' to ServerName in client.conf (e.g.,
     ServerName older.server.example.com/version=1.1) or to the CUPS_SERVER
     environment variable value or by adding it to the server name value of
     the '-h' option (e.g., lpstat -h older.server.example.com/version=1.1
     -p) the older IPP protocol version for older servers must be specified
     explicitly.
    </para>
    <para>
     CUPS Browsing is dropped in CUPS but the new package cups-filters
     provides the cups-browsed that provides basic CUPS Browsing and Polling
     functionality. The native protocol in CUPS for automatic client
     discovery of printers is now DNS-SD. Start cups-browsed on the local
     host to receive traditional CUPS Browsing information from traditional
     remote CUPS servers. To broadcast traditional CUPS Browsing information
     into the network so that traditional remote CUPS clients can receive
     it, set "BrowseLocalProtocols CUPS" in
     <literal>/etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf</literal> and start cups-browsed.
    </para>
    <para>
     Some printing filters and back-ends are dropped in CUPS but the new
     package cups-filters provides them. So cups-filters is usually needed
     (recommended by RPM) but cups-filters is not strictly required.
    </para>
    <para>
     The cupsd configuration directives are split into two files: cupsd.conf
     (can also be modified via HTTP PUT e.g. via cupsctl) and
     cups-files.conf (can only be modified manually by root) to have better
     default protection against misuse of privileges by normal users who
     have been specifically allowed by root to do cupsd configuration
     changes (see
     <ulink url="http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4223">http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4223</ulink>, CVE-2012-5519, and bnc#789566).
    </para>
    <para>
     CUPS banners and the CUPS test page are no longer supported since CUPS
     &gt;= 1.6. The banners and the test page from cups-filters must be
     used. The CUPS banner files in
     <literal>/usr/share/cups/banners/</literal> and the CUPS testpage
     <literal>/usr/share/cups/data/testprint</literal> (which is also a CUPS
     banner file type) are no longer provided in the cups RPM because they
     do no longer work since CUPS &gt;= 1.6 (see
     <ulink url="http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4120">http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4120</ulink>) because there is no longer a filter that can convert the CUPS banner
     files. Since CUPS &gt;= 1.6 only the banner files and testpage in the
     cups-filters package work via the cups-filters PDF workflow and the
     cups-filters package also provides the matching bannertopdf filter.
    </para>
    <para>

     <ulink url="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=735404">https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=735404</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Traditional CUPS version 1.5.4 Provided in the
     Legacy Module</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     We provide the last traditional CUPS version 1.5.4 as "cups154" RPMs in
     the "legacy" module. If CUPS version 1.7 does not support particular
     needs, you can still use CUPS 1.5.4 (under the conditions of the
     "legacy" module). This could be important, if you need a traditional
     CUPS server with original CUPS Browsing features.
    </para>
    <para>
     For those users any (semi)-automated CUPS version upgrade must be
     prohibited because CUPS &gt; 1.5.4 has major incompatible changes
     compared to CUPS &lt;= 1.5.4. Therefore the CUPS 1.5.4 RPM package name
     contains the version and it conflicts with higher versions. This way we
     avoid that an installed CUPS 1.5.4 gets accidentally replaced with a
     higher version. It is not possible to have different CUPS libraries
     versions installed at the same time.
    </para>
    <para>
     The API in CUPS 1.7 is compatible with the CUPS 1.5.4 API (existing
     functions are not changed) but newer CUPS libraries provide some new
     functions. There could be applications that might use newer CUPS
     library functions so that such applications would require the current
     CUPS 1.7 libraries. It is not possible to use CUPS 1.5.4 together with
     applications that require the current CUPS 1.7 libraries.
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">PDF Now Common Printing Data Format</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     There is a general move away from PostScript to PDF as the standard
     print job format. This change is advocated by the OpenPrinting
     workgroup of the Linux Foundation and the CUPS author.
    </para>
    <para>
     This means that application programs usually no longer produce
     PostScript output by default when printing but instead PDF.
    </para>
    <para>
     As a consequence the default processing how application programs
     printing output is converted into the "language" that the particular
     printer accepts (the so called "CUPS filter chain") has fundamentally
     changed from a PostScript-centric workflow to a PDF-centric workflow.
    </para>
    <para>
     Accordingly the upstream standard for CUPS under Linux (using CUPS plus
     the cups-filters package) is now PDF-based job processing, letting
     every non-PDF input be converted to PDF first, page management options
     being applied by a pdftopdf filter and Ghostscript being called with
     PDF as input.
    </para>
    <para>
     With PDF as the standard print job format traditional PostScript
     printers can no longer print application's printing output directly so
     that a conversion step in the printing workflow is required that
     converts PDF into PostScript. But there are also PostScript+PDF
     printers that can print both PostScript and PDF directly.
    </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>CPU Socket</term>

      The visible physical entity, as it is typically mounted to a

     <para>
      The (usually not visible) physical entity as reported by the CPU
      vendor.
     </para>
     <para>
      On System z this is equivalent to an IFL.

      This is what the Linux Kernel recognizes as a "CPU".
     </para>
     <para>
      We avoid the word "thread" (which is sometimes used), as the word
      "thread" would also become ambiguous subsequently.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Virtual CPU</term>

     <para>
      A logical CPU as seen from within a Virtual Machine.

    In Xen 4.4, the hypervisor bundled with SUSE Linux Enterprise
    Server 12, Dom0 is able to see and handle a maximum of 512 logical
    CPUs. The hypervisor itself, however, can access up to logical 256
    logical CPUs and schedule those for the VMs.

    <title>Migrate VMs from SLE11/xend to SLE12/libxl Using Live Migration</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>SLE 10 and SLE 11 use xend to manage guests. SLE 12 uses
     libxl to manage guests. Live migration from xend to libxl is not
     implemented, nothing in a libxl based tool stack is able to receive
     guests from xend. Furthermore, the data format which describes guest
     configuration differs slightly between xend and libxl.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis>The same applies to VMs managed by libvirtd because it uses
     either xend or libxl to manage a VM.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     At this point live migration from xend based hosts (SLE 10/SLE 11) to
     libxl based hosts (SLE12) is not possible. Shutdown the guest on the
     SLE 11 host and start it again on the SLE 12 host. For more information

    SUSE Linux Enterprise was the first enterprise Linux distribution to
    support journaling file systems and logical volume managers back in
    2000. Later we introduced xfs to Linux, which today is seen as the
    primary work horse for large-scale file systems, systems with heavy load
    and multiple parallel read- and write-operations. With SUSE Linux
    Enterprise 12 we are going the next step of innovation and are using the
    Copy on Write file system btrfs as the default for the operating system,
    to support system snapshots and rollback.

         * Btrfs is copy-on-write file system. Rather than journaling
         changes before writing them in-place, it writes them to a new
         location, then links it in. Until the last write, the new changes
         are not "committed". Due to the nature of the filesystem, quotas
         are implemented based on subvolumes ("qgroups"). The blocksize
         default varies with different host architectures. 64KiB is used on
         ppc64le, 4KiB on most other systems. The actual size used can be
         checked with the command "getconf PAGE_SIZE".

    The maximum file size above can be larger than the file system's actual
    size due to usage of sparse blocks. Note that unless a file system comes
    with large file support (LFS), the maximum file size on a 32-bit system
    is 2 GB (2^31 bytes). Currently all of our standard file systems
    (including ext3 and ReiserFS) have LFS, which gives a maximum file size
    of 2^63 bytes in theory. The numbers in the above tables assume that the
    file systems are using 4 KiB block size. When using different block
    sizes, the results are different, but 4 KiB reflects the most common
    standard.
