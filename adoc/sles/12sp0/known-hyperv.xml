 <title>Hyper-V: Time Synchronization</title>

 <para>
  The system time of a guest will drift several seconds per day.
 </para>
 <para>
  To maintain an accurate system time it is recommended to run
  <command>ntpd</command> in a guest. The ntpd daemon can be configured
  with the YaST "NTP Client" module. In addition to such a
  configuration, the following two variables must be set manually to
  "<literal>yes</literal>" in <filename>/etc/sysconfig/ntp</filename>:
 </para>
 <screen>NTPD_FORCE_SYNC_ON_STARTUP="yes"
NTPD_FORCE_SYNC_HWCLOCK_ON_STARTUP="yes"</screen>

   <para>
    Installation on the Btrfs filesystem or on LVM volumes in the guest
    is currently not supported; it will lead to a crash in the guest. It
    is recommended to use ext3 as the root filesystem instead.
   </para>
   <para>
    Also an update from SLES 11 SP1 to SLES 11 SP2 will fail, if the
    root filesystem is on LVM.

   <para>CHECKIT:SLE11.3</para>
   <para>
    Starting with SP2, SLES 11 has a newer block device driver, which presents all
    configured virtual disks as SCSI devices.  Disks, which used to
    appear as <filename>/dev/hda</filename> in SLES 11 SP1 will from now
    on appear as <filename>/dev/sda</filename>.

   <title>Using the "Virtual Machine Snapshot" Feature</title>
   <para>CHECKIT:SLE11.3</para>
   <para>
    The Windows Server Manager GUI allows to take snapshots of a Hyper-V
    guest.  After a snapshot is taken the guest will fail to reboot.  By
    default, the guest's root file system is referenced by the serial
    number of the virtual disk.  This serial number changes with each
    snapshot.  Since the guest expects the initial serial number,
    booting will fail.
   </para>
   <para>
    The solution is to either delete all snapshots
    using the Windows GUI, or configure the guest to mount partitions by
    file system UUID.  This change can be made with the YaST partitioner
    and boot loader configurator.
