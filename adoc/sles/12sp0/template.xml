     SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 has a 13 years life cycle, with 10 years of
General Support and 3 years of Extended Support. 
The current version (GA) will be fully maintained and supported until 6 months
after the release of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP1. If you need
additional time to design, validate and test your upgrade plans, Long Term
Service Pack Support can extend the support you get an additional 12 to 36
months in twelve month increments, giving you a total of 3 to 5 years of
support on any given service pack.

     to provide a technical preview later in the product cycle. </para>

     An important requirement for every Enterprise operating system is the
     level of support a customer receives for his environment.  Kernel
     modules are the most relevant connector between hardware
     ("controllers") and the operating system.

    <title>Live Migration of KVM Guest with Device Hot-Plugging</title>
    <para>CHECKIT:SLE11.3</para>
    <para>
     Hot-plugging a device (network, disk) works fine for a KVM guest on
     a SLES 11 host since SP1.  However, migrating the same guest with the
     hotplugged device (available on the destination host) fails.
    </para>
    <para>
     Since SLES 11 SP1, the hotplugging of the device to the KVM guest
     is supported, but migrating the guest with the hot-plugged device
     is not supported and expected to fail.
