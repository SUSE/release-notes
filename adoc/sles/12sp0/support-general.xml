 <section>
 <title>Support for the btrfs File System</title>
  
<para><emphasis>Btrfs is a copy-on-write (CoW) general purpose file system.  Based on the CoW functionality, btrfs provides snapshoting. Beyond that data and metadata checksums improve the reliability of the file system. btrfs is highly scalable, but also supports online shrinking to adopt to real-life environments. On appropriate storage devices btrfs also supports the TRIM command.</emphasis></para>
<para>
          <emphasis>Support</emphasis>
        </para>
<para>With SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2, the btrfs file system joins ext3, reiserfs, xfs and ocfs2 as commercially supported file systems. Each file system offers disctinct advantages. While the installation default is ext3, we recommend xfs when maximizing data performance is desired, and btrfs as a root file system when snapshotting and rollback capabilities are required. Btrfs is supported as a root file system (i.e. the file system for the operating system) across all architectures of SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2. Customers are advised to use the YaST partitioner (or AutoYaST) to build their systems: YaST will prepare the btrfs file system for use with subvolumes and snapshots. Snapshots will be automatically enabled for the root file system using SUSE's snapper infrastructure. For more information about snapper, its integration into ZYpp and YaST, and the YaST snapper module, see the SUSE Linux Enterprise documentation.</para>
<para>
          <emphasis>Migration from "ext" File Systems to btrfs</emphasis>
        </para>
<para>Migration from existing "ext" file systems (ext2, ext3, ext4) is supported "offline" and "in place".  Calling "btrfs-convert [device]" will convert the file system. This is an offline process, which needs at least 15% free space on the device, but is applied in place. Roll back: calling "btrfs-convert -r [device]" will roll back. Caveat: when rolling back, all data will be lost that has been added after the conversion into btrfs; in other words: the roll back is complete, not partial.</para>
<para>
          <emphasis>RAID</emphasis>
        </para>
<para>Btrfs is supported on top of MD (multiple devices) and DM (device mapper) configurations. Please use the YaST partitioner to achieve a proper setup. Multivolume/RAID with btrfs is not supported yet and will be enabled with a future
maintenance update.</para>
<para>
          <emphasis>Future Plans</emphasis>
        </para>
<itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>We are planning to announce support for btrfs' built-in multi volume handling and RAID in a later version of SUSE Linux Enterprise.</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>Starting with SUSE Linux Enterprise 12, we are planning to implement bootloader support for /boot on btrfs.</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>Transparent compression is implemented and mature. We are planning to support this functionality in the YaST partitioner in a future release.</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>We are commited to actively work on the btrfs file system with the community, and we keep customers and partners informed about progress and experience in terms of scalability and performance. This may also apply to cloud and cloud storage infrastructures.</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
<para>
          <emphasis>Online Check and Repair Functionality</emphasis>
        </para>
<para>Check and repair functionality ("scrub") is available as part of the btrfs command line tools. "Scrub" is aimed to verify data and metadata assuming the tree structures are fine.  "Scrub" can (and should) be run periodically on a mounted file system: it runs
as a background process during normal operation.</para>
<para>The tool "fsck.btrfs" tool will soon be available in the SUSE Linux Enterprise update repositories.</para>
<para>
          <emphasis>Capacity Planning</emphasis>
        </para>
<para>If you are planning to use btrfs with its snapshot capability, it is advisable to reserve twice as much disk space than the standard storage proposal. This is automatically done by the YaST2 partitioner for the root file system.</para>
<para>
          <emphasis>Hard Link Limitation</emphasis>
        </para>
<para>In order to provide a more robust file system, btrfs incorporates
back references for all file names, eliminating the classic "lost+found"
directory added during recovery. A temporary limitation of this approach
affects the number of hard links in a single directory that link to the
same file. The limitation is dynamic based on the length of the file
names used. A realistic average is approximately 150 hard links. When
using 255 character file names, the limit is 14 links. We intend to
raise the limitation to a more usable limit of 65535 links in a future
maintenance update.</para>
<note>
 <!-\- bnc#732564 -\->
 <para>
With SLE 11 SP3 you can now raise this limitation.  The so-called
<quote>extended inode refs</quote> are not turned on by default in the
SUSE kernels. This is
because enabling them involves turning on an incompat bit in the file system
which would make it unmountable by old versions of SLE.
 </para>
 <para>
If you want extended inode refs on though use 'btrfstune' to
turn them on. There is no way to turn them off so it is a 1-way
conversion. The command is (replace /PATH/TO/DEVICE with your device):
 </para>
 <screen>btrfstune -r /PATH/TO/DEVICE</screen>
</note>

<para>
          <emphasis>Other Limitations</emphasis>
        </para>
<para>At the moment, btrfs is not supported as a seed device.</para>
<para>

  <title>SELinux</title>
  <para>
	The SELinux subsystem is supported.
	Arbitrary SELinux policies running on SLES are not supported, though.
	Customers and Partners who have an interest in using
	SELinux in their solutions, are encouraged to contact SUSE to
	evaluate the level of support that is needed, and how support
	and services for the specific SELinux policies will be granted.
