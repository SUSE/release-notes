  <title>Lower Version Numbers in SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 than in
  Version 11 SP3</title>

<para>
When upgrading from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or Desktop 11 SP3 to
version 12, you may encounter a version downgrade of specific software
packages, including the Linux Kernel.
</para>

<para>
SLE 12 has all its software packages and updates in the SLE 12
repositories. No packages from SLE 11 SP3 repositories are needed for
installation or upgrade, not even from the SLE 11 SP3 update
repositories.
</para>
<note>
<para>
It is important to remember that the version number is not sufficient to
determine which bugfixes are applied to a software package.
</para>
</note>
<para>
In case you add SLE 11 SP3 update repositories, be aware of one
characteristic of the repository concept: Version numbers in the SP3
update repository can be higher than those in the SLE 12
repository. Thus, if you update with the SP3 repositories enabled, you
may get the SP3 version of a package instead of the SLE 12 version. This
is admittedly unfortunate.
</para>
<para>
It is recommended to avoid using the version from a lower product or SP,
because using the SLE 11 SP3 package instead of the SLE 12 package can
result in unexpected side effects.  Thus we advise to switch off all the
SLE 11 SP3 repositories, if you do not really need them.  Keep old
repositories only, if your system depends on a specific older package
version.

If you need a package from a lower product or SP though, and thus
have SLE 11 SP3 repositories enabled, make sure that the
packages you intended to upgrade have actually been upgraded.
</para>
<para>
Summarizing: If you have an SLE 11 SP3 installation with all patches and
updates applied, and then migrate off-line to SLE 12, you will see a
downgrade of some packages.  This is expected behavior.
</para>

    &yast; LDAP Server No Longer Uses
    <filename>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</filename>
   </title>
   <para>
    The &yast; LDAP Server module no longer stores the configuration of
    the LDAP Server in the file
    <filename>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</filename>.  It uses OpenLDAP's
    dynamic configuration backend, which stores the configuration in an
    LDAP database itself. That database consists of a set of
    <filename>.ldif</filename> files in the directory
    <filename>/etc/openldap/slapd.d</filename>.  You should - usually -
    not need to access those files directly. To access the configuration
    you can either use the <command>yast2-ldap-server</command> module
    or any capable LDAP client (e.g., ldapmodify, ldapsearch, etc.). For
    details on the dynamic configuration of OpenLDAP, refer to the
    OpenLDAP Administration Guide.

    AppArmor
   </title>
   <para>
     This release of &sles; ships with AppArmor.
     The AppArmor intrusion prevention framework builds a firewall around your
     applications by limiting the access to files, directories, and POSIX
     capabilities to the minimum required for normal operation. AppArmor
     protection can be enabled via the AppArmor control panel, located
     in YaST under Security and Users. For detailed information about using
     AppArmor, see the documentation in
     <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/apparmor-docs</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
     The AppArmor profiles included with &suselinux; have been developed with
     our best efforts to reproduce how most users use their
     software. The profiles provided work unmodified for many
     users, but some users may find our profiles too restrictive for their
     environments.
   </para>
   <para>
     If you discover that some of your applications do not function as you
     expected, you may need to use the AppArmor Update Profile Wizard in
     YaST (or use the aa-logprof(8) command line utility) to update your
     AppArmor profiles. Place all your profiles into learning mode with the
     following:
     <command>aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/*</command>
   </para>
   <para>
     When a program generates many complaints, the system's performance is
     degraded. To mitigate this, we recommend periodically running the Update
     Profile Wizard (or aa-logprof(8)) to update your profiles even if you
     choose to leave them in learning mode. This reduces the number of
     learning events logged to disk, which improves the performance of
     the system.

    Updating with Alternative Boot Loader (Non-Linux) or Multiple Boot Loader Programs
   </title>
   <para>
    CHECKIT:SLE11.3
   </para>
   <note>
   <para>
    Before updating, check the configuration of your boot loader to
    assure that it is not configured to modify any system areas (MBR,
    settings active partition or similar). This will reduce the amount
    of system areas that you need to restore after update.
   </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    Updating a system where an alternative boot loader (not grub) or an
    additional boot loader is installed in the MBR (Master Boot Record)
    might override the MBR and place grub as the primary boot loader
    into the system.
   </para>
   <para>
    In this case, we recommend the following: First backup your data.
    Then either do a fresh installation and restore your data, or run
    the update nevertheless and restore the affected system areas (in
    particular, the MBR).  It is always recommended to keep data
    separated from the system software.  In other words,
    <filename>/home</filename>, <filename>/srv</filename>, and other
    volumes containing data should be on separate partitions, volume
    groups or logical volumes.  The &yast; partitioning module will
    propose doing this.
   </para>
   <para>
    Other update strategies (except booting the install media) are safe
    if the boot loader is configured properly.  But the other strategies
    are not available, if you update from SUSE Linux Enterprise
    Server 10.

    SuSEfirewall2 is enabled by default, which means you cannot log in

   <title>Upgrading from &sles; 10 SP4 with the Xen Hypervisor May Have
   Incorrect Network Configuration</title>
   <para>
    CHECKIT:SLE11.3
   </para>

   <para>
    We have improved the network configuration: If you install &sles; 11
    SP3 and configure Xen, you get a bridged setup through YaST.
   </para>
   <para>
    However, if you upgrade from &sles; 10 SP4 to &sles; 11 SP3, the
    upgrade does not configure the bridged setup automatically.
   </para>

   <para>
    To start the bridge proposal for networking, start the "YaST Control
    Center", choose "Virtualization", then "Install Hypervisor and
    Tools".  Alternatively, call <command>yast2 xen</command> on the
    commandline.
