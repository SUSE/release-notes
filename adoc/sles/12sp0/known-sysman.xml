  <title>YaST Repair Tool Limitation</title>
  <para>
   The YaST Repair Tool as available from the boot medium does not
   detect pseudo devices like <filename>/dev/btrfs</filename> and writes
   a warning about missing partitions instead.
  </para>
  <para>
   You should skip the repair of such a device, because for such pseudo
   devices the availability of a partition is not expected.
  </para>

   <title>Modified Operation against Novell Customer Center</title>
   <para>
    Effective on 2009-01-13, provisional registrations have been disabled
    in the Novell Customer Center. Registering an instance of &sles; or
    Open Enterprise Server (OES) products now requires a valid, entitled
    activation code. Evaluation codes for reviews or proofs of concept
    can be obtained from the product pages and from the download pages
    on novell.com.
   </para>
   <para>
    If a device is registered without a code at setup time, a
    provisional code is assigned to it by Novell Customer Center (NCC),
    and it will be entered in your NCC list of devices. No update
    repositories are assigned to the device at this time.
   </para>

   <para>
    Once you are ready to assign a code to the device, start the YaST
    Novell Customer Center registration module and replace the
    un-entitled provisional code that NCC generated with the appropriate
    one to fully entitle the device and activate the related update
    repositories.

   <title>Operation against Subscription Management Tool</title>
   <para>
    Operation under the Subscription Management Tool (SMT) package and
    registration proxy is not affected. Registration against SMT will
    assign codes automatically from your default pool in NCC until all
    entitlements have been assigned. Registering additional devices once
    the pool is depleted will result in the new device being assigned a
    provisional code (with local access to updates) The SMT server will
    notify the administrator that these new devices need to be
    entitled.</para>
