  <title>Changed Routing Behavior</title>
    <para>
      &sles; 10 and &sles; 11 set <literal>net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter =
      1</literal> in <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> with the
      intention of enabling route path filtering.  However, the kernel
      fails to enable routing path filtering, as intended, by default in
      these products.
    </para>
    <para>
      Since SLES 11 SP1, this bug is fixed and most simple single-homed
      unicast server setups will not notice a change. But it may cause
      issues for applications that relied on reverse path filtering
      being disabled (e.g., multicast routing or multi-homed servers).

   <title>Kernel Devel Packages</title>
    <para>
      Starting with &sles; 11 Service Pack 1 the configuration files for recompiling the
      kernel were moved into their own sub-package:

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>kernel-flavor-devel</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        This package contains only the configuration for one kernel type
        (<quote>flavor</quote>), such as <literal>default</literal> or
        <literal>desktop</literal>.
