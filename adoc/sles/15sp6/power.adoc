==== DLPAR remove operation fails with Emulex FC adapters

Broadcom Emulex Fibre Channel (FC) adapters might fail to be properly removed with DLPAR operations in {productname} {this-version}.
All POWER 9 and Power10 systems with any Emulex FC adapter are affected.

When you perform DLPAR remove operations on Emulex FC adapters, there is a possibility that the adapter is not properly removed from the system.
This operation can cause future DLPAR operations to fail.
A future DLPAR add operation on the same FC adapter might cause symptoms including an EEH error followed by a kernel oops and system crash.
The following messages might be seen on a failing system:

There is currently no workaround nor fix available for this issue.
Instead of using the DLPAR operation, you can shutdown the logical partition before you remove or add Emulex FC adapters to the configuration.

==== Out of memory during installation

There is a limit on the memory available to the GRUB bootloader.
The installer ramdisk is particularly large because it includes kernel drivers for all possible installation scenarios as well as tools for loading the installer from different types of media.
Enabling secure boot and vTPM on the LPAR further increases memory requirements.

When loading the OS from the installation medium the following message might appear:

[source]
----
Loading kernel ...
Loading initial ramdisk ...
error: ../../grub-core/kern/mm.c:548:out of memory.

Press any key to continue...
----

The recommended workaround is to disable vTPM support during installation.
