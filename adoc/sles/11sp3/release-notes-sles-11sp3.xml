    <title>Support for the btrfs File System</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Btrfs is a copy-on-write (CoW) general purpose file system.
     Based on the CoW functionality, btrfs provides snapshoting. Beyond that
     data and metadata checksums improve the reliability of the file system.
     btrfs is highly scalable, but also supports online shrinking to adopt
     to real-life environments. On appropriate storage devices btrfs also
     supports the TRIM command.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Support</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     With SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2, the btrfs file system joins ext3,
     reiserfs, xfs and ocfs2 as commercially supported file systems. Each
     file system offers disctinct advantages. While the installation default
     is ext3, we recommend xfs when maximizing data performance is desired,
     and btrfs as a root file system when snapshotting and rollback
     capabilities are required. Btrfs is supported as a root file system
     (i.e. the file system for the operating system) across all
     architectures of SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2. Customers are advised to
     use the YaST partitioner (or AutoYaST) to build their systems: YaST
     will prepare the btrfs file system for use with subvolumes and
     snapshots. Snapshots will be automatically enabled for the root file
     system using SUSE's snapper infrastructure. For more information about
     snapper, its integration into ZYpp and YaST, and the YaST snapper
     module, see the SUSE Linux Enterprise documentation.
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Migration from "ext" File Systems to btrfs</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     Migration from existing "ext" file systems (ext2, ext3, ext4) is
     supported "offline" and "in place". Calling "btrfs-convert [device]"
     will convert the file system. This is an offline process, which needs
     at least 15% free space on the device, but is applied in place. Roll
     back: calling "btrfs-convert -r [device]" will roll back. Caveat: when
     rolling back, all data will be lost that has been added after the
     conversion into btrfs; in other words: the roll back is complete, not
     partial.
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis>RAID</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     Btrfs is supported on top of MD (multiple devices) and DM (device
     mapper) configurations. Please use the YaST partitioner to achieve a
     proper setup. Multivolume/RAID with btrfs is not supported yet and will
     be enabled with a future maintenance update.

      <para>
       We are commited to actively work on the btrfs file system with the
       community, and we keep customers and partners informed about progress
       and experience in terms of scalability and performance. This may also
       apply to cloud and cloud storage infrastructures.

     <emphasis>Online Check and Repair Functionality</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     Check and repair functionality ("scrub") is available as part of the
     btrfs command line tools. "Scrub" is aimed to verify data and metadata
     assuming the tree structures are fine. "Scrub" can (and should) be run
     periodically on a mounted file system: it runs as a background process
     during normal operation.
    </para>

     <emphasis>Capacity Planning</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     If you are planning to use btrfs with its snapshot capability, it is
     advisable to reserve twice as much disk space than the standard storage
     proposal. This is automatically done by the YaST2 partitioner for the
     root file system.
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Hard Link Limitation</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     In order to provide a more robust file system, btrfs incorporates back
     references for all file names, eliminating the classic "lost+found"
     directory added during recovery. A temporary limitation of this
     approach affects the number of hard links in a single directory that
     link to the same file. The limitation is dynamic based on the length of
     the file names used. A realistic average is approximately 150 hard
     links. When using 255 character file names, the limit is 14 links. We
     intend to raise the limitation to a more usable limit of 65535 links in
     a future maintenance update.
    </para>
    <note>
<!-- bnc#732564 -->
     <para>
      With SLE 11 SP3 you can now raise this limitation. The so-called
      <quote>extended inode refs</quote> are not turned on by default in the
      SUSE kernels. This is because enabling them involves turning on an
      incompat bit in the file system which would make it unmountable by old
      versions of SLE.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you want extended inode refs on though use 'btrfstune' to turn them
      on. There is no way to turn them off so it is a 1-way conversion. The
      command is (replace /PATH/TO/DEVICE with your device):

    Technology previews are packages, stacks, or features delivered by SUSE.
    These features are not supported. They may be functionally incomplete,
    unstable or in other ways not suitable for production use. They are
    mainly included for customer convenience and give customers a chance to
    test new technologies within an enterprise environment.
   </para>
   <para>
    Whether a technical preview will be moved to a fully supported package
    later, depends on customer and market feedback. A technical preview does
    not automatically result in support at a later point in time. Technical
    previews could be dropped at any time and SUSE is not committed to
    provide a technical preview later in the product cycle.

     It is possible to run SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 on a shared

     read-only root file system, a scratch and a state file system. The

     directories on the read-only root file system are replaced by which
     files on the state and scratch file systems for each system instance.

     The <filename>readonlyroot</filename> kernel command line option
     enables read-only root mode; the <filename>state=</filename> and

   <title>Mapping Network Interface Names to Names Written on the Chassis (biosdevname)</title>
   <para>
    This feature addresses the issue that eth0 does not map to em1 (as
    labeled on server chassis), when a server has multiple network adapters.
   </para>
   <para>
    This issue is solved for Dell hardware, which has the corresponding BIOS
    support, by renaming onboard network interfaces to em[1234], which maps
    to Embedded NIC[1234] as labeled on server chassis. (em stands for
    ethernet-on-motherboard.)
   </para>
   <para>
    The renaming will be done by using the biosdevname utility.
   </para>
   <para>
    biosdevname is automatically installed and used if YaST2 detects
    hardware suitable to be used with biosdevname. biosdevname can be
    disabled during installation by using "biosdevname=0" on the kernel
    commandline. The usage of biosdevname can be enforced on every hardware
    with "biosdevname=1". If the BIOS has no support, no network interface
    names are renamed.

    <title>Kernel Dumps with LZO Compression</title>
    <para>
     Dumping on large machines (i.e. with terabytes of RAM) takes
     unreasonably long.
    </para>
    <para>
     The default and recommended settings for kdump have changed in SP3 to
     provide faster dumping on machines with a large amount of RAM. This
     includes changing the default dump level to 31 (filter out as much as
     possible) and using the LZO compression algorithm. LZO is much faster
     than GZIP while offering a similar compression ratio for typical dumps.
    </para>

     SLE 11 SP3 introduces the upgrade of the MySQL database to version 5.5.
     This upgrade involves a change of the database format and the database

    </para>
<screen>touch /var/lib/mysql/.force_upgrade

    <para>
     The LVS/ipvs load balancing code did not fully support RFC2460 and
     fragmented IPv6 packets which could lead to lost packets and
     interrupted connections when IPv6 traffic was fragmented.
    </para>
    <para>
     The load balancer has been enhanced to fully support IPv6 fragmented
     extension headers and is now RFC2460 compliant.

    <title>Mapping Network Interface Names to Names Written on the Chassis (biosdevname)</title>
    <para>
     This feature addresses the issue that eth0 does not map to em1 (as
     labeled on server chassis), when a server has multiple network
     adapters.
    </para>
    <para>
     This issue is solved for Dell hardware, which has the corresponding
     BIOS support, by renaming onboard network interfaces to em[1234], which
     maps to Embedded NIC[1234] as labeled on server chassis. (em stands for
     ethernet-on-motherboard.)
    </para>
    <para>
     The renaming will be done by using the biosdevname utility.
    </para>
    <para>
     biosdevname is automatically installed and used if YaST2 detects
     hardware suitable to be used with biosdevname. biosdevname can be
     disabled during installation by using "biosdevname=0" on the kernel
     commandline. The usage of biosdevname can be enforced on every hardware
     with "biosdevname=1". If the BIOS has no support, no network interface
     names are renamed.

     The libseccomp library provides an easy to use interface to the Linux
     Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism, seccomp. The libseccomp API
     allows an application to specify which syscalls, and optionally which
     syscall arguments, the application is allowed to execute, all of which

    <title>LXC Requires Correct Network Configuration</title>
    <para>
     LXC now comes with support for network gateway detection. This feature
     will prevent a container from starting, if the network configuration
     setup of the container is incorrect. For instance, you must make sure
     that the network address of the container is within the host ip range,
     if it was set up as brigded on host. You might need to specify the
     netmask of the container network address (using the syntax
     "<literal>lxc.network.ipv4 = X.Y.Z.T / cidr</literal>") if the netmask
     is not the network class default netmask).
    </para>
    <para>
     When using DHCP to assign a container network address, ensure
     "<literal>lxc.network.ipv4 = 0.0.0.0</literal>" is used in your
     configuration template.
    </para>
    <para>
     Previously a container would have been started but the network would
     not have been working properly. Now a container will refuse to start,
     and print an error message stating that the gateway could not be set
     up. For containers created before this update we recommend running
     <literal>rcnetwork restart</literal> to reestablish a container network
     connection.

     <title>LXC Maintenance Update</title>

      After installing LXC maintenance update, we recommend clearing the LXC
      SLES cache template (stored by default in

      in the SLES template are available in newly created containers.
     </para>
     <para>
      For containers created before the update, we recommend to install the
      packages "supportconfig", "sysconfig", and "iputils" using zypper.

    <title>Add Support for TIPC (Transparent Inter-Process Communication)</title>
    <para>
     The Transparent Inter-Process Communication protocol (TIPC) allows
     applications in a cluster environment to communicate quickly and
     reliably with each other, regardless of their location within the
     cluster. TIPC includes a network topology service that lets
     applications track both functional and physical changes in the network,
     helping to synchronize startup of distributed applications and their
     responses to failure conditions. A socket API is used to interact with
     the topology service and other applications. Address assignment and
     bearer configuration is managed from a userspace application called
     <literal>tipc-config</literal>. More information about TIPC can be
     found at <link xlink:href="https://tipc.sourceforge.net/"/>.

    <title>'Click-on-touch' and 'click-on-relase' for xf86-input-evdev Input Driver</title>
    <para>
     Kiosk style systems (cash registers, vending machines, etc.) with
     touchscreens need to make sure, touchscreen 'clicks' are delivered
     accurately at the point where the touch screen was touched initially
     ie. where a widget element was 'pressed'. Virtually all UI toolkits
     wait for a button relase to happen to accept a 'click' and to record
     the location to determine the widget element 'clicked'. This behavior
     is undesirable for kiosk style systems. At the same time kiosk style
     systems use a fixed window placement: the user should not be able to
     'drag' windows around.
    </para>
    <para>
     To remedy this the following approaches would be possible:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Use of a special UI toolkits developed for this purpose. However this

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Use of touchscreens which syntesize a 'button release' event right
       after a 'button press' regardless if the finger is still touching the
       screen or not. Such touch screens exist.
      </para>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       A customized input driver which is able to emulate this feature: This

       screens and toolkits.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
     For this the 'klick-on-touch' and 'klick-on-release' feature has been
     added to the updated evdev input driver (xf86-input-evdev). The feature
     can be enabled either statically using a config file or 'on-the'fly' at
     run time by changing the approriate properties on the input device.
     Please refer to the evdev man page (man 4 evdev). Device properties can
     be set by an X application (for instance a cash register software) or
     generically using the tool 'xinput' (refer to 'man 1 xinput').
    </para>
    <para>
     The following options can be set:
    </para>
<screen>1. mode:
  0 - default press/release behavior,
  1 - click-on-touch: button release is syntesized immediately after a
      'button press',
  2 - click-on-release: the button press event is delayed until the finger
      is lifted off the screen and a release event is generated.
2. button:
  the button to which this behavior is applied (since touchscreens generate a button 1
  event for screen touches, this usually doesn't need to be modified).
3. delay:
  To allow for visual feedback, a small delay may be introduced between press
  and release. Finger movements during the delay period do not generate position
  events nor are they reflected in the position of the release event. The delay time
  is set in miliseconds. A value of 100 (.1 sec) is sufficient to obtain a visible visual
  feedback.</screen>

    <para>
     With a SLE 11 SP3 maintenance update resp. the general update to SLE 11

     1.1 is available, which lets you change the resolution on the fly. The
     Gnome desktop provides a tool to do this and save the settings
     persistently across sessions.

     For any UMS (and RandR 1.1) drivers you will still get the full list of

     a monitor preferred default mode will be used instead.

   <title>Update Python to 2.6.8</title>
   <para>
    Python 2.6.7 and 2.6.8 are security only updates to 2.6.6.
   </para>
   <para>
    Python 2.6 helps with migrating to Python 3.0, which is a major redesign
    of the language. Whenever possible, Python 2.6 incorporates new features
    and syntax changes from 3.0 while remaining compatible with existing
    code. In case of conflict, Python 2.6 adds compatibility functions in a
    <literal>future_builtins</literal> module and a <literal>-3</literal>
    switch to warn about usages that will become unsupported in 3.0.
   </para>
   <para>
    Some significant new packages have been added to the standard library,
    such as the multiprocessing and json modules.

    <title>Upgrading PostgreSQL Installations from 8.3 to 9.1</title>
    <para>
     To upgrade a PostgreSQL server installation from version 8.3 to 9.1,
     the database files need to be converted to the new version.
    </para>
    <para>
     Newer versions of PostgreSQL come with the
     <literal>pg_upgrade</literal> tool that simplifies and speeds up the
     migration of a PostgreSQL installation to a new version. Formerly dump
     and restore was needed that was much slower.
    </para>
    <para>
     <literal>pg_upgrade</literal> needs to have the server binaries of both
     versions available. To allow this, we had to change the way PostgreSQL
     is packaged as well as the naming of the packages, so that two or more
     versions of PostgreSQL can be installed in parallel.
    </para>
    <para>
     Starting with version 9.1, PostgreSQL package names contain numbers
     indicating the major version. In PostgreSQL terms the major version
     consists of the first two components of the version number, i.e. 8.3,
     8.4, 9.0, or 9.1. So, the packages for Postgresql 9.1 are named
     postgresql91, postgresql91-server, etc. Inside the packages the files
     were moved from their standard locations to a versioned location such
     as <literal>/usr/lib/postgresql83/bin</literal> or
     <literal>/usr/lib/postgresql91/bin</literal> to avoid file conflicts if
     packages are installed in parallel. The
     <literal>update-alternatives</literal> mechanism creates and maintains
     symbolic links that cause one version (by default the highest installed
     version) to re-appear in the standard locations. By default, database
     data are stored under <literal>/var/lib/pgsql/data</literal> on SUSE
     Linux.
    </para>
    <para>
     The following preconditions have to be fulfilled before data migration
     can be started:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       If not already done, the packages of the old PostgreSQL version must
       be upgraded to the new packaging scheme through a maintenance update.
       For SLE 11 this means to install the patch that upgrades PostgreSQL
       from version 8.3.14 to 8.3.19 or higher.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The packages of the new PostgreSQL major version need to be
       installed. For SLE11 this means to install postgresql91-server and
       all the packages it depends on. As <literal>pg_upgrade</literal> is
       contained in postgresql91-contrib, that one has to be installed as
       well, at least until the migration is done.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Unless <literal>pg_upgrade</literal> is used in link mode, the server
       must have enough free disk space to temporarily hold a copy of the
       database files. If the database instance was installed in the default
       location, the needed space in megabytes can be determined by running
       the follwing command as root: "du -hs /var/lib/pgsql/data". If space
       is tight, it might help to run the "VACUUM FULL" SQL command on each
       database in the instance to be migrated, but be aware that it might
       take very long.
      </para>

     Upstream documentation about <literal>pg_upgrade</literal> including
     step by step instructions for performing a database migration can be

     (if the postgresql91-docs package is installed)<!--, or online under
     <link xlink:href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/pgupgrade.html"/>. NOTE: The online documentation starts with explaining how you can
     install PostgreSQL from the upstream sources (which is not necessary on
     SLE) and also uses other directory names (<literal>/usr/local</literal> instead of the
     <literal>update-alternatives</literal> based path as described above)-->.

    <title>Lower Version Numbers in SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP3 than in SP2</title>
    <para>
     When upgrading from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or Desktop 11 SP2 to
     SP3, you may encounter a version downgrade of specific software
     packages, including the Linux Kernel.
    </para>
    <para>
     SLE 11 SP3 has all its software packages and updates in the SP3
     repositories. No packages from SP2 repositories are needed for
     installation or upgrade, not even from the SP2 update repositories.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      It is important to remember that the version number is not sufficient
      to determine which bugfixes are applied to a software package.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     In case you add SP2 update repositories, be aware of one characteristic
     of the repository concept: Version numbers in the SP2 update repository
     can be higher than those in the SP3 repository. Thus, if you update
     with the SP2 repositories enabled, you may get the SP2 version of a
     package instead of the SP3 version. This is admittedly unfortunate.
    </para>
    <para>
     It is recommended to avoid using the version from a lower SP, because
     using the SP2 package instead of the SP3 package can result in
     unexpected side effects. Thus we advise to switch off all the SP2
     repositories, if you do not really need them. Keep old repositories
     only, if your system depends on a specific older package version. If
     you need a package from a lower SP though, and thus have SP2
     repositories enabled, make sure that the packages you intended to
     upgrade have actually been upgraded.
    </para>
    <para>
     Summarizing: If you have an SP2 installation with all patches and
     updates applied, and then migrate off-line to SP3 GA, you will see a
     downgrade of some packages. This is expected behavior.

    <title>YaST LDAP Server No Longer Uses <filename>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</filename></title>
    <para>
     The YaST LDAP Server module no longer stores the configuration of the
     LDAP Server in the file <filename>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</filename>.
     It uses OpenLDAP's dynamic configuration backend, which stores the
     configuration in an LDAP database itself. That database consists of a
     set of <filename>.ldif</filename> files in the directory
     <filename>/etc/openldap/slapd.d</filename>. You should - usually - not
     need to access those files directly. To access the configuration you
     can either use the <command>yast2-ldap-server</command> module or any
     capable LDAP client (e.g., ldapmodify, ldapsearch, etc.). For details
     on the dynamic configuration of OpenLDAP, refer to the OpenLDAP

    <title>AppArmor</title>
    <para>
     This release of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server ships with AppArmor. The
     AppArmor intrusion prevention framework builds a firewall around your
     applications by limiting the access to files, directories, and POSIX
     capabilities to the minimum required for normal operation. AppArmor
     protection can be enabled via the AppArmor control panel, located in
     YaST under Security and Users. For detailed information about using
     AppArmor, see the documentation in
     <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/apparmor-docs</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
     The AppArmor profiles included with SUSE Linux have been developed with
     our best efforts to reproduce how most users use their software. The
     profiles provided work unmodified for many users, but some users may
     find our profiles too restrictive for their environments.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you discover that some of your applications do not function as you
     expected, you may need to use the AppArmor Update Profile Wizard in
     YaST (or use the aa-logprof(8) command line utility) to update your
     AppArmor profiles. Place all your profiles into learning mode with the
     following: <command>aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/*</command>
    </para>
    <para>
     When a program generates many complaints, the system's performance is
     degraded. To mitigate this, we recommend periodically running the
     Update Profile Wizard (or aa-logprof(8)) to update your profiles even
     if you choose to leave them in learning mode. This reduces the number
     of learning events logged to disk, which improves the performance of
     the system.

    <title>Updating with Alternative Boot Loader (Non-Linux) or Multiple Boot Loader Programs</title>
    <note>
     <para>
      Before updating, check the configuration of your boot loader to assure
      that it is not configured to modify any system areas (MBR, settings
      active partition or similar). This will reduce the amount of system
      areas that you need to restore after update.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     Updating a system where an alternative boot loader (not grub) or an
     additional boot loader is installed in the MBR (Master Boot Record)
     might override the MBR and place grub as the primary boot loader into
     the system.
    </para>
    <para>
     In this case, we recommend the following: First backup your data. Then
     either do a fresh installation and restore your data, or run the update
     nevertheless and restore the affected system areas (in particular, the
     MBR). It is always recommended to keep data separated from the system
     software. In other words, <filename>/home</filename>,
     <filename>/srv</filename>, and other volumes containing data should be
     on separate partitions, volume groups or logical volumes. The YaST
     partitioning module will propose doing this.
    </para>
    <para>
     Other update strategies (except booting the install media) are safe if
     the boot loader is configured properly. But the other strategies are
     not available, if you update from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10.

    In SUSE Linux Enterprise (up version 11 SP2) we provided "rpcbind",
    which is compatible with portmap. "rpcbind" now provides full IPv6
    support. Thus support for portmap ended with the release of SLE 11 SP3.

   <title>L3 Support for Openswan Is Scheduled to Expire</title>
   <para>
    L3 support for Openswan is scheduled to expire. This decision is driven
    by the fact that Openswan development stalled substantially and there
    are no tangible signs that this will change in the future.
   </para>
   <para>
    In contrast to this the strongSwan project is vivid and able to deliver
    a complete implementation of current standards. Compared to Openswan all
    relevant features are available by the package strongSwan plus
    strongSwan is the only complete Open Source implementation of the RFC
    5996 IKEv2 standard whereas Openswan only implements a small mandatory
    subset. For now and the expected future only strongSwan qualifies to be
    an enterprise-ready solution for encrypted TCP/IP connectivity.

    <title>Linux Completely Fair Scheduler Affects Java Performance</title>
    <para>
     Problem (Abstract)
    </para>
    <para>
     Java applications that use synchronization extensively might perform
     poorly on Linux systems that include the Completely Fair Scheduler. If
     you encounter this problem, there are two possible workarounds.
    </para>
    <para>
     Symptom
    </para>
    <para>
     You may observe extremely high CPU usage by your Java application and
     very slow progress through synchronized blocks. The application may
     appear to hang due to the slow progress.
    </para>
    <para>
     Cause
    </para>
    <para>
     The Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) was adopted into the mainline Linux
     kernel as of release 2.6.23. The CFS algorithm is different from
     previous Linux releases. It might change the performance properties of
     some applications. In particular, CFS implements sched_yield()
     differently, making it more likely that a thread that yields will be
     given CPU time regardless.
    </para>
    <para>
     The new behavior of sched_yield() might adversely affect the
     performance of synchronization in the IBM JVM.
    </para>
    <para>
     Environment
    </para>
    <para>
     This problem may affect IBM JDK 5.0 and 6.0 (all versions) running on
     Linux kernels that include the Completely Fair Scheduler, including
     Linux kernel 2.6.27 in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11.
    </para>
    <para>
     Resolving the Problem
    </para>
    <para>
     If you observe poor performance of your Java application, there are two
     possible workarounds:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Either invoke the JVM with the additional argument
       <option>"-Xthr:minimizeUserCPU"</option>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Or configure the Linux kernel to use the more backward-compatible
       heuristic for sched_yield() by setting the sched_compat_yield tunable
       kernel property to <option>1</option>. For example:
      </para>
<screen>echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/sched_compat_yield</screen>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
     You should not use these workarounds unless you are experiencing poor
     performance.

    <title>Tuning Performance of Simple Database Engines</title>
    <para>
     Simple database engines like Berkeley DB use memory mappings (mmap(2))
     to manipulate database files. When the mapped memory is modified, those
     changes need to be written back to disk. In SUSE Linux Enterprise 11,
     the kernel includes modified mapped memory in its calculations for
     deciding when to start background writeback and when to throttle
     processes which modify additional memory. (In previous versions, mapped
     dirty pages were not accounted for and the amount of modified memory
     could exceed the overall limit defined.) This can lead to a decrease in
     performance; the fix is to increase the overall limit.
    </para>
    <para>
     The maximum amount of dirty memory is 40% in SUSE Linux Enterprise 11
     by default. This value is chosen for average workloads, so that enough
     memory remains available for other uses. The following settings may be
     relevant when tuning for database workloads:

    <title>Multipathing: SCSI Hardware Handler</title>
    <para>
     Some storage devices, e.g. IBM DS4K, require special handling for path
     failover and failback. In SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2, dm
     layer served as hardware handler.
    </para>
    <para>
     One drawback of this implementation was that the underlying SCSI layer
     did not know about the existence of the hardware handler. Hence, during
     device probing, SCSI would send I/O on the passive path, which would
     fail after a timeout and also print extraneous error messages in the
     console.
    </para>
    <para>
     In SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11, this problem is resolved by moving
     the hardware handler to the SCSI layer, hence the term SCSI Hardware
     Handler. These handlers are modules created under the SCSI directory in
     the Linux Kernel.
    </para>
    <para>
     In SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11, there are four SCSI Hardware
     Handlers: <literal>scsi_dh_alua</literal>,
     <literal>scsi_dh_rdac</literal>, <literal>scsi_dh_hp_sw</literal>,
     <literal>scsi_dh_emc</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     These modules need to be included in the initrd image so that SCSI
     knows about the special handling during probe time itself.

    <title>Hyper-V: Driver to Support Host Initiated Backup</title>
    <para>
     This driver supports a host initiated backup of the guest. On Windows
     guests, the host can generate application consistent backups using the
     Windows VSS framework. On Linux, we ensure that the backup will be file
     system consistent. This driver allows the host to initiate a "Freeze"
     operation on all the mounted file systems in the guest. Once the
     mounted file systems in the guest are frozen, the host snapshots the
     guest's file systems. Once this is done, the guest's file systems are
     "thawed".

    <title>Hyper-V: Framebuffer Driver</title>
    <para>
     The guest window size was limited to standard VGA resolutions. To
     select a resolution the guest had to be booted with the "vga=number"
     kernel command line option.
    </para>
    <para>
     There is now a framebuffer driver for Hyper-V guests. It allows for
     screen resolution up to Full HD 1920x1080 on Windows Server 2012 host,
     and 1600x1200 on Windows Server 2008 R2 or earlier.
    </para>
    <para>
     When upgrading from earlier releases the "vga=number" option has to be
     replaced with the "video=hyperv_fb:resolution" option to specifiy the
     desired guest window size. Example: To force the guest window size to
     800x600 add "video=hyperv_fb:800x600" to the kernel command line
     options.

    <title>Using the "Virtual Machine Snapshot" Feature</title>
    <para>
     The Windows Server Manager GUI allows to take snapshots of a Hyper-V
     guest. After a snapshot is taken the guest will fail to reboot. By
     default, the guest's root file system is referenced by the serial
     number of the virtual disk. This serial number changes with each
     snapshot. Since the guest expects the initial serial number, booting
     will fail.
    </para>
    <para>
     The solution is to either delete all snapshots using the Windows GUI,
     or configure the guest to mount partitions by file system UUID. This
     change can be made with the YaST partitioner and boot loader
     configurator.

        The Postfix SMTP client(!) no longer tries to use the obsolete SSLv2
        protocol by default, as this may prevent the use of modern SSL
        features. Lack of SSLv2 support should never be a problem, since
        SSLv3 was defined in 1996, and TLSv1 in 1999. You can undo the
        change by specifying empty <literal>main.cf</literal> values for
        smtp_tls_protocols and lmtp_tls_protocols.

        Postfix SMTP server replies for address verification have changed.
        unverified_recipient_reject_code and unverified_sender_reject_code

        with unverified_sender_defer_code and

        Postfix now adds (Resent-) From:, Date:, Message-ID: or To: headers

        The meaning of an empty filter next-hop destination has changed (for

        the recipient domain, instead of using $myhostname as in Postfix 2.6
        and earlier. To restore the old behavior specify
        "default_filter_nexthop = $myhostname", or specify a non-empty
        next-hop content filter destination.

        Postfix now requests default delivery status notifications when

        Postfix now reports a temporary delivery error when the result of

        To avoid repeated delivery to mailing lists with pathological nested
        alias configurations, the <literal>local(8)</literal> delivery agent
        now keeps the owner-alias attribute of a parent alias, when
        delivering mail to a child alias that does not have its own owner
        alias.

        The Postfix SMTP client no longer appends the local domain when
        looking up a DNS name without ".". Specify
        "smtp_dns_resolver_options = res_defnames" to get the old behavior,
        which may produce unexpected results.

        The format of the "postfix/smtpd[pid]: queueid: client=host[addr]"
        logfile record has changed. When available, the before-filter client
        information and the before-filter queue ID are now appended to the

        Postfix by default no longer adds a "To: undisclosed-recipients:;"

        The Postfix SMTP server now always re-computes the SASL mechanism
        list after successful completion of the STARTTLS command. Earlier
        versions only re-computed the mechanism list when the values of
        smtp_sasl_tls_security_options and smtp_sasl_security_options
        differ. This could produce incorrect results, because the Dovecot
        authentication server may change responses when the SMTP session is
        encrypted.

        The smtpd_starttls_timeout default value is now stress-dependent. By

        Postfix no longer appends the system-supplied default CA
        certificates to the lists specified with *_tls_CAfile or with
        *_tls_CApath. This prevents third-party certificates from getting
        mail relay permission with the permit_tls_all_clientcerts feature.
        Unfortunately this change may cause compatibility problems when
        configurations rely on certificate verification for other purposes.
        Specify "tls_append_default_CA = yes" for backwards compatibility.

        The VSTREAM error flags are now split into separate read and write

     <para>
      While this functionality is welcomed in most environments, it requires

      In virtualized environments, specifically but not exclusively on s390x

     <para>
      The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 version of OpenSSH does not support
      AES-GCM ciphers.
     </para>
     <para>
      We now provide a OpenSSH version built against OpenSSL 1, which
      supports AES-GCM ciphers, a modern and commonly used and required
      cipher.

     <title>Providing TLS 1.2 Support for Apache2 Via mod_nss</title>
     <para>
      The Apache Web server offers HTTPS protocol support via mod_ssl, which
      in turn uses the openssl shared libraries. SUSE Linux Enterprise
      Server 11 SP2 and SP3 come with openssl version 0.9.8j. This openssl
      version supports TLS version up to and including TLSv1.0, support for
      newer TLS versions like 1.1 or 1.2 is missing.
     </para>
     <para>
      Recent recommendations encourage the use of TLSv1.2, specifically to
      support Perfect Forward Secrecy. To overcome this limitation, the SUSE
      Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2, SP3, and SP4 are supplied with
      upgrades to recent versions of the mozilla-nss package and with the
      package apache2-mod_nss, which makes use of mozilla-nss for TLSv1.2
      support for the Apache Web server.
     </para>
     <para>
      An additional <literal>mod_nss</literal> module is supplied for
      <literal>apache2</literal>, which can coexist with all existing
      libraries and apache2 modules. This module uses the <literal>mozilla
      netscape security services</literal> library, which supports TLS 1.1
      and TLS 1.2 protocols. It is not a drop-in replacement; configuration
      and certificate storages are different. It can coexist with
      <literal>mod_ssl</literal> if necessary.
     </para>

      The package includes a sample configuration and a README-SUSE.txt for
      setup guidance.

      As this is a hardware flaw. It is not fixable except by upgrading your

      this flaw is that a malicious PV guest user can halt the host system.

     <title>Missing 32-Bit Compatibility Libraries for libstdc++ and libg++ on 64-Bit Systems (x86_64)</title>
     <para>
      32-bit (x86) compatibility libraries like "libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3"
      have been available on x86_64 in the package "compat-32-bit" with SUSE
      Linux Enterprise Server 9, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10, and are
      also available on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 medium
      (compat-32-bit-2009.1.19), but are not included in SUSE Linux
      Enterprise Server_11.
     </para>
     <para>
      Background
     </para>
     <para>
      The respective libraries have been deprecated back in 2001 and shipped
      in the compatibility package with the release of SUSE Linux Enterprise
      Server 9 in 2004. The package was still shipped with SUSE Linux
      Enterprise Server 10 to provide a longer transition period for
      applications requiring the package.
     </para>
     <para>
      With the release of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 the compatibility
      package is no longer supported.
     </para>
     <para>
      Solution
     </para>
     <para>
      In an effort to enable a longer transition period for applications
      still requiring this package, it has been moved to the unsupported
      "Extras" channel. This channel is visible on every SUSE Linux
      Enterprise Server 11 system, which has been registered with the Novell
      Customer Center. It is also mirrored via SMT alongside the supported
      and maintained SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 channels.
     </para>
     <para>
      Packages in the "Extras" channel are not supported or maintained.
     </para>
     <para>
      The compatibility package is part of SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11
      due to a policy difference with respect to deprecation and deprecated
      packages as compared to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11.
     </para>
     <para>
      We encourage customers to work with SUSE and SUSE's partners to
      resolve dependencies on these old libraries.

     <title>32-Bit Devel-Packages Missing from the Software Development Kit (x86_64)</title>

     </para>
     <para>
      Background
     </para>
     <para>
      SUSE supports running 32-bit applications on 64-bit architectures;
      respective runtime libraries are provided with SUSE Linux Enterprise
      Server 11 and fully supported. With SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 we also
      provided 32-bit devel packages on the 64-bit Software Development Kit.
      Having 32-bit devel packages and 64-bit devel packages installed in
      parallel may lead to side-effects during the build process. Thus with
      SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 we started to remove some (but not yet all)

     The POWER7 processor has a register, referred to as Sample Instruction
     Address Register. This register is loaded with the contents of
     instruction address when a sample of a performance monitoring event is
     taken. If an instruction that was executed speculatively is rolled
     back, the event is also rolled back but the contents of SIAR are not
     cleared and thus invalid. The kernel has no way of detecting that the
     contents of SIAR are invalid. This can result in a few profiling
     samples with incorrect instruction addresses.
    </para>

     The POWER7+ processor adds a new bit, referred to as SIAR-Valid bit and

    <title>Kernel cpuidle Framework for POWER7</title>
    <para>
     Enable POWER systems to leverage the generic cpuidle framework by
     taking advantage of advanced heuristics, tunables and features provided
     by the cpuidle framework. This enables better power management on the
     systems and helps tune the system and applications accordingly.

    <title>Loading the Installation Kernel via Network on POWER</title>
    <para>
     With SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 the bootfile
     <filename>DVD1/suseboot/inst64</filename> can not be booted directly
     via network anymore, because its size is larger than 12MB. To load the
     installation kernel via network, copy the files
     <filename>yaboot.ibm</filename>, <filename>yaboot.cnf</filename> and
     <filename>inst64</filename> from the <filename>DVD1/suseboot</filename>
     directory to the TFTP server. Rename the
     <filename>yaboot.cnf</filename> file to
     <filename>yaboot.conf</filename>. yaboot can also load config files for
     specific Ethernet MAC addresses. Use a name like
     <filename>yaboot.conf-01-23-45-ab-cd-ef</filename> to match a MAC
     address. An example <filename>yaboot.conf</filename> for TFTP booting

    <title>Huge Page Memory Support on POWER</title>
    <para>
     Huge Page Memory (16GB pages, enabled via HMC) is supported by the
     Linux kernel, but special kernel parameters must be used to enable this
     support. Boot with the parameters "<literal>hugepagesz=16G
     hugepages=N</literal>" in order to use the 16GB huge pages, where N is
     the number of 16GB pages assigned to the partition via the HMC. The
     number of 16GB huge pages available can not be changed once the
     partition is booted. Also, there are some restrictions if huge pages
     are assigned to a partition in combination with eHEA / eHCA adapters:
    </para>
    <para>
     IBM eHEA Ethernet Adapter:
    </para>
    <para>
     The eHEA module will fail to initialize any eHEA ports if huge pages
     are assigned to the partition and Huge Page kernel parameters are
     missing. Thus, no huge pages should be assigned to the partition during
     a network installation. To support huge pages after installation, the
     huge page kernel parameters need to be added to the boot loader
     configuration before huge pages are assigned to the partition.
    </para>
    <para>
     IBM eHCA InfiniBand Adapter:
    </para>
    <para>
     The current eHCA device driver is not compatible with huge pages. If
     huge pages are assigned to a partition, the device driver will fail to
     initialize any eHCA adapters assigned to the partition.

     <title>Existing Data Execution Protection Removed for System z</title>
     <para>
      The existing data execution protection for Linux on System z relies on
      the System z hardware to distinguish instructions and data through the
      secondary memory space mode. As of System z10, new load-relative-long
      instructions do not make this distinction. As a consequence,
      applications that have been compiled for System z10 or later fail when
      running with the existing data execution protection.

      Therefore, data execution protection for Linux on System z has been

     <title>kdump Support for System z</title>
     <para>
      kdump can be used to create system dumps for instances of SUSE Linux
      Enterprise Server. kdump reduces both dump time and dump size and
      facilitates dump disk storage sharing. A setup GUI is provided by
      YaST. When performing an upgrade to SLES 11 SP3 and enabling kdump,
      please note that kdump reserves approximately 128 MB by default and
      sufficient disk space must be available for storing the dump.
     </para>
     <para>
      Depending on the number of devices that are used in the system the
      memory reserved for kdump needs to be adjusted. If less than fourty
      devices are configured for the respective system, no action is
      required. If more than fourty devices are configured, please add one
      megabyte of system main storage for each additional 25 devices.
     </para>
     <para>
      If too many devices are used in the system the setup of kdump may
      fail, because too many devices are written to kernel command line.
      This line must not exceed 896 characters. One way to shorten the line
      is to specify ranges of devicenumbers instead of listing each device
      individually (!0800,!0801,!0802 becomes !0800-0802).

     The libseccomp library provides an easy to use interface to the Linux
     Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism, seccomp. The libseccomp API
     allows an application to specify which syscalls, and optionally which
     syscall arguments, the application is allowed to execute, all of which
     are enforced by the Linux Kernel.

     QEMU guests spawned by libvirt are exposed to a large number of system

    </para>
    <para>
     libvirt's <literal>qemu.conf</literal> file is updated with a
     seccomp_sandbox option that can be used to enable use of QEMU's seccomp
     sandboxing support. This allows execution of QEMU guests with reduced

    <title>libvirt Bridged Networking for Unprivileged Users</title>
    <para>
     libvirt can already spawn QEMU guests with bridged networking support
     when running under a privileged user ID, however it cannot do the same
     when run under an unprivileged user ID.
    </para>
    <para>
     libvirt is updated to enable QEMU guests to be spawned with bridged
     networking when libvirt is run under an unprivileged user ID. This
     benefits installations that connect to the libvirtd instance with the
     <literal>qemu:///session</literal> URI. This was achieved by using the
     new QEMU network helper support when libvirt is running under an
     unprivileged user ID.

    <title>libvirt DAC Isolation</title>
    <para>
     libvirt spawns all QEMU guests created through the qemu:///system URI
     under the user ID and group ID defined in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf. This
     means all guests are run under the same user ID and group ID, removing
     all Discretionary Access Control (DAC). While Mandatory Access Control
     (MAC) may already be isolating guests, it would be nice to also have
     DAC isolation for an added layer of security.
    </para>
    <para>
     libvirt has been updated to allow spawning of guests under unique user
     and group IDs. The libvirt domain XML's &lt;seclabel&gt; tag is updated
     with model='dac' to provide this support, and libvirt APIs are updated
     to allow applications to inspect the full list of security labels of a
     domain.

    <para>
     QEMU guests previously could not be started with bridged networking
     support when run under an unprivileged user ID.
    </para>
    <para>
     Infrastructure is introduced to enable a network helper to be executed
     by QEMU. This also allows third parties to implement user-visible
     network backends without having to introduce them into QEMU itself. A
     default network helper is introduced that implements the same bridged
     networking functionality as the common qemu-ifup script. It creates a
     tap file descriptor, attaches it to a bridge, and passes it back to
     QEMU. This helper runs with higher privileges, allowing QEMU to be
     invoked with bridged networking support under an unprivileged user.

    <title>QEMU: Sandboxing with seccomp</title>
    <para>
     New seccomp kernel functionality is intended to be used to declare the
     whitelisted syscalls and syscall parameters. This will limit QEMU's
     syscall footprint, and therefore the potential kernel attack surface.
     The idea is that if an attacker were to execute arbitrary code, they
     would only be able to use the whitelisted syscalls.
    </para>
    <para>
     QEMU has been updated with the '-sandbox' option. When set to 'on', the
     '-sandbox' option will enable seccomp system call filtering for QEMU,
     allowing only a subset of system calls to be used.

    <title>KVM: Support INVPCID's Haswell Instructions</title>
    <para>
     KVM now support the new Intel Haswell microarchitecture instructions:
     INVPCID. Process-context identifiers (PCIDs) are a facility by which a
     logical processor may cache information for multiple linear-address
     spaces so that the processor may retain cached information when
     software switches to a different linear address space. INVPCID
     instruction is used for fine-grained TLB flush which is benefit for
     kernel. This features is now exposed to the guest. Modern guest can use
     this new instructiosn to improve the efficiency of KVM. qemu-kvm is
     required to selects PCID via "-cpu" option.

    SUSE Linux Enterprise was the first enterprise Linux distribution to
    support journaling file systems and logical volume managers back in
    2000. Today, we have customers running XFS and ReiserFS with more than
    8TiB in one file system, and our own SUSE Linux Enterprise engineering

    We propose to use XFS for large-scale file systems, on systems with
    heavy load and multiple parallel read- and write-operations (e.g., for
    file serving with Samba, NFS, etc.). XFS has been developed for such
    conditions, while typical desktop use (single write or read) will not
    necessarily benefit from its capabilities.

         * Btrfs is supported in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service
         Pack3; Btrfs is a copy-on-write logging-style file system. Rather
         than journaling changes before writing them in-place, it writes
         them to a new location, then links it in. Until the last write, the
         new changes are not "committed". Due to the nature of the
         filesystem, quotas will be implemented based on subvolumes in a
         future release. The blocksize default varies with different host
         architectures. 64KiB is used on ppc64 and IA64, 4KiB on most other
         systems. The actual size used can be checked with the command
         "getconf PAGE_SIZE".

    The maximum file size above can be larger than the file system's actual
    size due to usage of sparse blocks. Note that unless a file system comes
    with large file support (LFS), the maximum file size on a 32-bit system
    is 2 GB (2^31 bytes). Currently all of our standard file systems
    (including ext3 and ReiserFS) have LFS, which gives a maximum file size
    of 2^63 bytes in theory. The numbers in the above tables assume that the
    file systems are using 4 KiB block size. When using different block
    sizes, the results are different, but 4 KiB reflects the most common
    standard.

    <title>ext4: Runtime Switch for Write Support</title>
    <para>
     The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 kernel contains a fully supported ext4
     file system module, which provides read-only access to the file system.
     A separate package is not required.
    </para>
    <para>
     Read-write access to an ext4 file system can be enabled by using the
     <literal>rw=1</literal> module parameter. The parameter can be passed
     while loading the ext4 module manually, by adding it for automatic use
     by creating <literal>/etc/modprobe.d/ext4</literal> with the contents
     <literal>options ext4 rw=1</literal>, or after loading the module by
     writing <literal>1</literal> to
     <literal>/sys/module/ext4/parameters/rw</literal>. Note that
     read-write ext4 file systems are still officially unsupported by SUSE
     Technical Services.

   <title>Kernel Modules</title>
   <para>
    An important requirement for every Enterprise operating system is the
    level of support a customer receives for his environment. Kernel modules
    are the most relevant connector between hardware ("controllers") and the
    operating system. Every kernel module in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11
    has a flag 'supported' with three possible values: <literal>"yes",
    "external", ""</literal> (empty, not set, "unsupported").
   </para>
   <para>
    The following rules apply:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      All modules of a self-recompiled kernel are by default marked as
      unsupported.

      Kernel Modules supported by SUSE partners and delivered using SUSE's
      Partner Linux Driver process are marked "external".
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If the <literal>"supported"</literal> flag is not set, loading this
      module will taint the kernel. Tainted kernels are not supported. To
      avoid this, not supported Kernel modules are included in an extra RPM
      (kernel-&lt;flavor&gt;-extra) and will not be loaded by default
      ("flavor"=default|smp|xen|...). In addition, these unsupported modules
      are not available in the installer, and the package
      kernel-$flavor-extra is not on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server media.

    While the general supportability is important, there might occur
    situations where loading an unsupported module is required (e.g., for
    testing or debugging purposes, or if your hardware vendor provides a
    hotfix):
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      You can override the default by changing the variable
      <option>allow_unsupported_modules</option> in
      <filename>/etc/modprobe.d/unsupported-modules</filename> and set the
      value to "<literal>1</literal>".
     </para>
     <para>
      If you only want to try loading a module once, the
      <option>--allow-unsupported-modules</option> command-line switch can
      be used with <filename>modprobe</filename>. (For more information, see
      <command>man modprobe</command>).
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>

    SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 is compliant to IPv6 Logo Phase 2.
    However, when running the respective tests, you may see some tests
    failing. For various reasons, we cannot enable all the configuration
    options by default, which are necessary to pass all the tests. For

     </para>
     <para>
      Some tests fail because of the default DAD handling in Linux;
      disabling the complete interface is possible, but not the default
      behavior (because security-wise, this might open a DoS attack vector,
      a malicious node on a network could shutdown the complete segment)
      this is still conforming to RFC 4862: the shutdown of the interface is
      a "should", not a mandatory ("must") rule.
     </para>
     <para>
      The Linux kernel allows you to change the default behavior with a
      sysctl parameter. To do this on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11, you
      need to make the following changes in configuration:

        the second change to work, if ipv6 is not loaded early enough,

     IP set is an optimized extension module for iptables allowing to match
     large volumes of IP, network, or MAC addresses. Typical use of the

    <title>libica 2.1.0 Available since SLES 11 SP2 for s390x</title>
    <para>
     The libica package contains the interface library routines used by IBM
     modules to interface with IBM Cryptographic Hardware (ICA). Starting
     with SLES 11 SP1, libica is provided in the s390x distribution in
     three flavors of packages: libica-1_3_9, libica-2_0_2, and libica-2_1_0
     providing libica versions 1.3.9, 2.0.2, and 2.1.0 respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
     libica 1.3.9 is provided for compatibility reasons with legacy hardware
     present e.g. in the ppc64 architecture. For s390x users it is always
     recommended to use the new libica 2.1.0 library since it supports all
     newer s390x hardware, larger key sizes and is backwards compatible with
     any ICA device driver in the s390x architecture.
    </para>
    <para>
     You may choose to continue using libica 1.3.9 or 2.0.2 if you do not
     have newer Cryptographic hardware to exploit or wish continue using
     custom applications that do not support the libica 2.1.0 library yet.
     Both openCryptoki and openssl-ibmca, the two main exploiters for the
     libica interface, are provided starting with SLES 11 SP2 to support
     the newer libica 2.1.0 library.
