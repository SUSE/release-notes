  <remark> SLE definition: general information </remark>
  <para>
   SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop is the market's only enterprise-quality
   Linux desktop ready for routine business use. Developed and backed by
   SUSE, SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop provides market-leading usability,
   seamless interoperability with existing IT systems, and dozens of
   essential applications—all at a fraction of the price of proprietary
   operating systems. It comes bundled with the latest versions of leading
   applications such as LibreOffice office productivity suite, Mozilla
   Firefox web browser, and Evolution e-mail and calendar suite. In
   addition, it integrates with Microsoft SharePoint and Novell Teaming for
   group collaboration and supports a wide range of multimedia file formats,
   wireless and networking standards, and plug-and-play devices.
  </para>
  <para>
   Through the latest enhancements in power management and security, SUSE
   Linux Enterprise Desktop also provides an environmentally friendly IT
   experience (Green IT) and an error-proof desktop. Finally, SUSE Linux
   Enterprise Desktop offers unparalleled flexibility. You can deploy it on
   a wide range of thick client devices (including desktops, notebooks,
   netbooks, and workstations), on thin client devices, or as a virtual
   desktop. By leveraging the power of SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop, your
   business can dramatically reduce costs, improve end user security and
   increase workforce productivity.

    <title>If You Are Using Third-Party KMPs Such As Proprietary Graphics Drivers, Perform an Online Upgrade</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>If you are using third-party kernel modules packages (KMP)
     and perform an offline upgrade to SLED 12 SP1, the repositories
     containing these modules are disabled automatically. However, the
     packages already installed are kept, even though they are incompatible.
     The upgraded system will now try to use the outdated drivers, often
     leading to issues.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Examples for commonly-used third-party KMPs are the
     proprietary graphics drivers from AMD or NVidia. Booting with an
     outdated graphics driver can lead to the X Window System failing to
     start.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     If you are using third-party KMPs, always perform an online upgrade.
     This allows for automatically updating the repository URLs needed for
     the packages.

    <title>Updating Registration Status After Rollback</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>When performing a service pack migration, it is necessary to
     change the configuration on the registration server to provide access
     to the new repositories. If the migration process is interrupted or
     reverted (via restoring from a backup or snapshot), the information on
     the registration server is inconsistent with the status of the system.
     This may lead to you being prevented from accessing update repositories
     or to wrong repositories being used on the client.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     When a rollback is done via Snapper, the system will notify the
     registration server to ensure access to the correct repositories is set
     up during the boot process. If the system was restored any other way or
     the communication with the registration server failed for any reason
     (for example, because the server was not accessible due to network
     issues), trigger the rollback on the client manually by calling
     <literal>snapper rollback</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     We suggest always checking that the correct repositories are set up on
     the system, especially after refreshing the service using
     <literal>zypper ref -s</literal>.

    <title>[GMC] Lower Version Numbers in SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP1 Than in Version 12</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>When upgrading from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or Desktop
     12 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or Desktop 12 SP1, you may
     experience a version downgrade of specific software packages, including
     the Linux Kernel.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     This is expected behavior. It is important to remember that the version
     number is not sufficient to determine which bug fixes are applied to a
     software package.
    </para>
    <para>
     All SLE 12 SP1 software packages and updates are contained in the SLE
     12 SP1 repositories. No packages from SLE 12 repositories are needed
     for installation or upgrade.
    </para>
    <para>
     In case you do add SLE 12 update repositories, be aware of one
     characteristic of the repository concept: Version numbers in the SLE 12
     update repository can be higher than those in the SLE 12 SP1
     repository. Thus, if you update with the SLE 12 repositories enabled,
     you may receive the SLE 12 version of a package instead of the SLE 12
     SP1 version.
    </para>
    <para>
     Using package versions from a lower product version or SP can result in
     unwanted side effects. If you do not need them, switch off all SLE 12
     repositories.
    </para>
    <para>
     Only keep old repositories if your system depends on a specific older
     version of a package. If you need a package from a lower product
     version or SP though, and thus have SLE 12 repositories enabled, make
     sure that the packages you intended to upgrade have actually been
     upgraded.

    <title>New Method of Online Migration Between Service Packs</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>In the past, you could use YaST Wagon to migrate between
     Service Packs. YaST Wagon is now unsupported.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     You can now use either the <emphasis>YaST Online Migration</emphasis>

    </para>
    <para>
     Note that when performing the SP migration, both YaST and Zypper will
     install all recommended packages. Especially in the case of custom
     minimal installations, this may increase the installation size of the
     system significantly.

       <literal>solver.onlyRequires = true</literal>. This changes the
       behavior of all package operations, such as the installation of
