   Release notes usually only list changes that happened between two
   subsequent releases. Always review all release notes documents that apply
   in your upgrade scenario.
<!-- Not yet in SLED RN... to come? - sknorr, 2017-07-03 -->
<!-- Certain important entries from the release notes documents of
   previous product versions are repeated. To make these entries easier to
   identify, they contain a note to that effect.
  </para>
  <para>
   However, repeated entries are provided as a courtesy only. Therefore, if
   you are skipping one or more service packs, check the release notes of the
   skipped service packs as well. If you are only reading the release notes
   of the current release, you could miss important changes. -->
