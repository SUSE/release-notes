==== FTP support stopped

For security reasons Mozilla has removed the default support for clicking on FTP links in Firefox.
You can enable this support by adding `network.gio.supported-protocols=ftp:` via the `about:config` settings.
This will enable desktop support via the GNOME Virtual File System (GVFS). See the GVFS documentation for all supported protocols.
