    <title>Support for AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization</title>
    <para>
     As a technology preview, SLE 15 now supports AMD Secure Encrypted
     Virtualization (SEV). SEV integrates main memory encryption
     capabilities (SME) with the existing AMD-V virtualization architecture
     to support encrypted virtual machines. Encrypting virtual machines
     helps protect them from physical threats and other virtual machines or
     even the hypervisor itself. SEV represents a new approach to security
     that is particularly suited to cloud computing where virtual machines
     may not fully trust the hypervisor and administrator of their host
     system. As with SME, no application software modifications are required
     to support SEV.

    <para>
     With SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, support for ReiserFS will be completely
     removed from YaST and the installer will block the upgrade when it
     detects a ReiserFS file system.
    </para>

    To provide protection against physical attacks on a system, AMD SME can
    provide full or partial memory encryption depending on the use case, on
    AMD family 17h CPU processors. Full memory encryption means all DRAM
    contents are encrypted using random keys. This provides strong
    protection against cold boot, DRAM interface snooping and similar types
    of attacks. This technology is especially prominent for systems equipped
    with NVDIMMs whose contents remain intact after powering down the
    system.
   </para>

    Memory encryption support is present in SLE 15 kernels but not enabled

   <title>GPG Does Not Support GPG V3 Keys Anymore, Resulting in Zypper/rpm Warnings</title>
   <para>
    <emphasis> SLE 12 shipped with GPG 2.0, while SLE 15 includes GPG 2.2.
    In between these GPG versions, support for GPG V3 keys was removed. If
    your system's key database still contains GPG V3 keys, you may receive
    warnings about this when executing Zypper or
    </emphasis><literal>rpm</literal><emphasis> commands, as these commands
    are checking the integrity of the package database. These warnings take
    the form </emphasis><literal>warning: Unsupported version of key:
    V3</literal><emphasis>. </emphasis>
   </para>
   <para>
    Usually, these warnings are benign, as these keys may have been used for
    repositories that are no longer enabled on the system or that have since
    had key updates. However, if these keys are still in active use by the
    upstream repository, they must be replaced as soon as possible:
   </para>

      The keys in themselves are insecure. Hence, even though older package
      management tools will use them to verify integrity of packages, the
      result of this check cannot be trusted anymore.

   <title>firewalld Replaces SuSEfirewall2 as Default Software Firewall</title>
   <para>
    <emphasis>SuSEfirewall2 was originally tailored towards running a router

    network interfaces or virtual networking.</emphasis>
   </para>
   <para>
    To allow greater flexibility in SLE 15, the default firewall has been
    switched to the firewalld upstream solution. It provides a resident
    daemon process which can dynamically adjust firewall rules on behalf of
    the user or other programs. SuSEfirewall2 is no longer available.
   </para>
   <para>
    There is no automatic migration from SuSEfirewall2 to firewalld. To
    migrate an existing SuSEfirewall2 configuration to firewalld, you can
    use the script from the package
    <literal>susefirewall2-to-firewalld</literal>. However, after running
    the script, you still need to manually adjust and verify the resulting
    firewalld rules.

   <title>No Default Compose Key Combination</title>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      To define a system-wide custom compose key combination, use the file

<screen>[...]
!! Third example: Change right Control key to Compose key.
!! To do Compose Character, press this key and afterwards two

!remove  Control  = Control_R
!keysym Control_R = Multi_key
!add     Control  = Control_R
[...]</screen>
     <para>
      To uncomment the example code, remove the <literal>!</literal>
      characters at the beginning of lines. However, note that the setup

<screen>setxkbmap [...] -option compose:COMPOSE_KEY</screen>

   <title>Wayland Cannot Be Used on Machines with Hybrid GPUs</title>
   <para>
    <emphasis>On SLED 15, hybrid GPUs are not fully supported on Wayland.
    This affects, for example, laptops that have an integrated Intel GPU and
    a discrete Nvidia or AMD GPU connected to the HDMI ports. When the BIOS
    of a machine is set to use discrete graphics, GNOME will automatically
    fall back to starting an X session (which better supports the discrete
    GPU).</emphasis>

    There is an <emphasis>unsupported</emphasis> workaround to use Wayland
    when a discrete graphic card is enabled. This workaround brings up GNOME

    graphic cards are not allowed in this configuration and it can lead to
    additional display-related issues.

    <title>ntpd Has Been Replaced With Chrony</title>
    <para>
     The time server synchronization daemon <literal>ntpd</literal> has been
     replaced with the more modern daemon Chrony.
    </para>
    <para>
     This change means that AutoYaST files with an
     <literal>ntp_client</literal> section need to be updated to a new
     format for this section. For more information about the new AutoYaST
     <literal>ntp_client</literal> format, see <emphasis>AutoYaST Guide,
     section NTP Client</emphasis> (<ulink url="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/singlehtml/book_autoyast/book_autoyast.html#Configuration.Network.Ntp"/>).
    </para>
    <para>
     To sync time in intervals, YaST sets up a cron configuration file. From
     SLE 15 on, the configuration file used for this is owned by the package
     <literal>yast2-ntp-client</literal> (previously no package owned it).
     The configuration file has been renamed from
     <literal>novell.ntp-synchronization</literal> to
     <literal>suse-ntp_synchronization</literal> to be consistent with other
     cron configuration files. The upgrade from <literal>ntpd</literal> to
     Chrony is performed automatically during the SLE upgrade: If a file
     with the old name is found, it will be renamed and references to
     <literal>ntpd</literal> in it will be replaced by
     <literal>chrony</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     <literal>ntpd</literal> has been moved to the Legacy module. For more
