=== Enabling GNOME Session Restore Does Not Work

You can have GNOME restore your previous desktop session when logging in.
In the past, this could be achieved by enabling the dconf entry `/org/gnome/gnome-session/auto-save-session`.
In GNOME 3.34, the upstream GNOME project disabled this functionality because it caused issues under newer versions of systemd.
As {product} uses GNOME 3.34, the functionality cannot be used in {product} {this-version} anymore.
