   <title>HiDPI support in GNOME</title>
   <para>
    Starting with SLE 15 SP1, there are several improvements to HiDPI
    support. If the DPI of your display is greater than 144, GNOME will
    scale the Session to a 2:1 ratio automatically and deliver you a crisp
    and sharp user experience. You can adjust the scaling-factor value
    manually under GNOME Control Center's display panel.
   </para>
   <para>
    However, there are limitations to this support:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fractional scaling is still considered experimental in GNOME 3.26.2,
      so you can only set the scaling factor to a whole number.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      X11 apps may appear blury under a HiDPI Wayland session (via
      XWayland), as per-display scaling is not supported on X11.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Using multiple monitors with different DPI is not supported,
      scale-monitor-framebuffer is still an immature feature so you cannot
      set per-monitor scales in GNOME Control Center.

   <para>
    SLED 15 SP1 now uses the upstream GNOME Initial Setup tool (<literal>gnome-initial-setup</literal>) the first time a user logs in.
    However, as many settings for user are already made by the system
    installation (that is by YaST or autoyast), GNOME Initial Setup will
    only configure keyboard layout/IBus input methods.
   </para>

    Other screens of the tool have been disabled. GNOME Initial Setup will
    also not run prior to the initial login of the first user.

   <title>Use <command>update-alternatives</command> to Set Display Manager and Desktop Session</title>
