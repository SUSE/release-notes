* Update to version 4.5.8:
* Warewulf v4.5.8 simplifies the `+wwinit+` boot process for SELinux and
configures tmpfs to spread the node image across all available NUMA
nodes. It also improves the detection of kernels in the container image
to more reliably detect the newest available kernel and to avoid debug /
rescue kernels.
* Warewulf v4.5.7 fixes the ability to override overlay files configured
in profiles with overlays configured per-node; fixes a template
processing bug bug in development-time overlay rendering; and improves
the preview dracut-based boot process to better support a "`secure`"
boot process.
* added option which allows to copy in file on wwctl container exec and
keep them, if they were modified.
* Update to version 4.5.6 with following changes:
** Show more information during `+wwctl container <shell|exec>+` about
when and if the container image will be rebuilt.
** Command-line completion for
`+wwctl overlay <edit|delete|chmod|chown>+`.
** Display an error during boot if no container is defined.
** `+wwctl container list --kernel+` shows the kernel detected for each
container.
** `+wwctl container list --size+` shows the uncompressed size of each
container. `+--compressed+` shows the compressed size, and `+--chroot+`
shows the size of the container source on the server.
** Add a logrotate config for `+warewulfd.log+`.
