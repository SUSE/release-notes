 <title>Technology Previews</title>

 <para>
  Technology previews are packages, stacks, or features delivered by &suse;
  which are not supported. They may be functionally incomplete, unstable or
  in other ways not suitable for production use. They are included for your
  convenience and give you a chance to test new technologies within an
  enterprise environment.
 </para>

 <para>
  Whether a technology preview becomes a fully supported technology later
  depends on customer and market feedback.
  Technology previews can be dropped at any time and &suse; does not commit
  to providing a supported version of such technologies in the future.
 </para>

 <para>
  Give your &suse; representative feedback about technology previews,
